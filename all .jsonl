The New York Times best seller list is a weekly list that ranks the best-selling books in the United States based on sales data from a number of different retailers. The list is published in the New York Times newspaper and is widely considered to be one of the most influential best seller lists in the book industry. \nIt's important to note that the New York Times best seller list is not the only best seller list out there, and there are many other lists that rank the top-selling books in different categories or in different countries. So it's possible that a book could be a best seller on one list but not on another. \nAdditionally, the term \"best seller\" is often used more broadly to refer to any book that is selling well, regardless of whether it is on a specific best seller list or not.

When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ?

An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .","There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details \/ information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics \/ information \/ details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs \/ tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital \/ HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local \/ low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts ."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \n1.

HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels.

{"question":"magic the gathering What is it . how popular is it . who plays it . The culture behind it .. etc . etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is .. Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder 's toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .","Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .","Something that I find helps understand the game a great deal : Richard Garfield , pHD made the game as an economics paper . He wanted to see how people allocate resources , but also loved Dungeons and Dragons . If you look at the first set , you have your initial creatures of each color as an Angel ( W ) , Dragon ( R ) , Wurm ( G ) , Djinn ( U ) and Vampire ( B ) . The mana sources were played once a turn , and how you used it mattered . You could use your one mana to play a creature , or allocate those resources towards something else . You could destroy someone 's ability to produce resources . You can avoid creatures ( monsters ) all together . As the game progressed , it branched out greatly from basic D & D. Now we have entire sets of cards dedicated to a single mythos . We had 2013 as a Greek mythology themed sets , complete with gods interacting with mortals , two years before that we had a whole set of gothic horror complete with werewolves , giests and families of elitist vampires . The game has thousands of cards , some extremely valuable , some not , but it all started to see if we could attach some modicum of economics to D & D."],"chatgpt_answers":["Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game that was first published in 1993.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Like viruses , they are ( groups of ) molecules that reproduce without metabolism . Unlike any other self - replicating system , prions are proteins that have a unique structure . One part of how a protein functions is the amino acid sequence that makes up the primary structure , but the other part is how the proteins folds , either by itself or with the help of other folder - helper proteins . Prions have the same amino acid sequence as their properly folded brethren , but they are folded differently , and they make a chain reaction by folding their brethren to be like them . Cruetzfeld - Jakob disease in humans , Mad Cow disease in cows , and chronic wasting disease in deer , are all prion diseases that affect neuronal proteins .","A prion is a special kind of deformed protein . When it comes in contact with normal proteins , it causes them to deform in the same way . So not only are the proteins deformed will no longer to their jobs , they spread the deformity to other proteins .","They are one of the most compelling reasons to manage the livestock and food industry . Forget that they are nearly impossible to eliminate by cooking if they are in your foodstuffs . Forget the horrible , horrible way they kill . The only reason prions prolifferate is by feeding animal waste products back to your stock animals . Bovine spongiform , scrapie and CJD are all caused by eating an animals brain \/ spinal fluid . Surely this should not be happening ? People should have the right to trust their foodstuffs and should not be feeding dead animals back to other livestocks . That is what scares me ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Prions are tiny particles that can cause serious and often fatal diseases in people and animals. They are made up of proteins, which are important building blocks in the body. Normally, proteins have a specific shape that helps them do their job. But prions are abnormal proteins that have a different shape, and they can cause other proteins around them to change shape too. When this happens, it can cause problems in the body because the proteins are not able to work properly. \nPrions are not viruses, and they do not contain any genetic material (like DNA or RNA) like viruses do. Instead, they are thought to be able to change the shape of proteins by acting as a kind of template for other proteins to copy. \nPrion diseases can be very serious and are often fatal. Some examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as \"mad cow disease\") in cows. These diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food or medical equipment, but they can also occur spontaneously in some people. \nThere is currently no cure for prion diseases, and they can be difficult to diagnose. Researchers are working to better understand how prions cause disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

People respond to all sorts of different drugs . Even more confusingly , people who do not respond to one serotonin drug may do well on a different serotonin drug . People do have physical symptoms such as fatigue , weakness , appetite changes , etc . If these symptoms are driven by the brain or if they come from some other mechanism is n't really known either . There are some diseases like Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Fibromyalgia which have a strong statistical relationship with mental health disorders such as depression , but we do n't understand the root cause enough to say for sure how they are related .","The ' brain ' and body in general is always trying to equalize a ' chemical normal ' which is defined in real - time by your static DNA & dynamic RNA signatures .

If you 're filming a movie over the course of a year , you might be able to shut down an area for a few days of shooting , but if you need that space often you 're not going to be able to shut down a park or roads every few days . Also , if you 're filming in a public area it 's hard to stop the public from wandering in or watching from as close as possible . also , they can build the set without certain walls or in certain ways so camera angles that are n't possible in real places you can suddenly do .

Control: Building a set allows the filmmakers to have complete control over the look and feel of the environment in which they are shooting. This can be especially important if the story takes place in a fantastical or fictional world, or if the filmmakers want to create a specific mood or atmosphere. \n2. Cost: While it may seem like it would be cheaper to film on location, this is not always the case. Renting a location can be expensive, especially if the filmmakers need to use it for an extended period of time. Additionally, the filmmakers may need to pay to use certain locations, or they may have to pay to have the location altered in some way to suit their needs. \n3. Logistics: Filming on location can also be logistically challenging. The filmmakers may need to deal with crowds, noise, and other distractions, which can make it difficult to get the shots they need. Additionally, the filmmakers may not have access to all of the resources they need on location, such as electricity, water, or special equipment. \n4. Safety: Finally, building a set can be safer for the cast and crew. Filming on location can involve dealing with hazards such as traffic, unstable terrain, or inclement weather. By building a set, the filmmakers can create a controlled environment where these hazards are minimized. \nOverall, building sets can be more expensive upfront, but it can also be more cost-effective in the long run, as it allows the filmmakers to have greater control over their shooting environment and reduce the risk of delays or unexpected costs."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"What is a \" Tor exit node \" or \" Tor node \" What is a \" Tor exit node \" or \" Tor node \" ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal \/ request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)","Tor is an encryption system that bounces your data between dozens of computers around the world , each computer unravelling one layer of encryption that tells it who to send it to next , to make it tough to trace . Each one of those computers is a node , and the one at the end of the chain - where your data hits the rest of the internet - is an exit node .","TOR is a routing system and stands for ' The Onion Router ' because it works in layers , just like an ogre or an onion . A TOR node is a node that participates in a TOR network , i.e. a server somewhere on the planet . The exit node is just the last node in a given configuration , i.e. the node just before the server you want to reach . TOR is used to hide the identity of the user . TOR works like this : you take your message and encrypt it with multiple encryption algorithms - one for every TOR node you want to route through . Thus layers . You do it in the following order : the most outer layer is encrypted so the the very first TOR node and only the very first TOR node can decipher it . The second outer layer is encrypted so the the second TOR route can decipher it and so on , and the last layer is encrypted so that the exit node can decipher it . This means that if you send your message to the first node he gets rid of the most outer layer . The message is still scrambled and unreadable because there are still as many encryption layers as there are TOR routes left . Now , provided you use end - to - end encryption on top of using TOR this system becomes pretty good at hiding your identity because for every single node in the configuration the node only knows where any given message came from and where it has to go . It does n't know if it 's the first one that got the message or the last one and it does n't know what 's written in it .

This can trigger a reflex that causes you to feel like you are falling or to experience a sensation of vertigo. \nAnother reason people may experience the sensation of falling in their dreams is due to changes in their brain activity while they are sleeping. During the dreaming stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain is more active and may produce vivid and sometimes strange or surreal dreams. In some cases, the sensation of falling may be part of the dream content and may be related to the dreamer's feelings or emotions. \nFinally, the sensation of falling in dreams may be related to the way our brains process and interpret sensory information while we are asleep.

If you hold the knife with the blade facing up, it might be more difficult to control the blade and keep it from slipping as you make the cut. On the other hand, if you hold the knife with the blade facing down, it will be easier to keep the blade steady and apply more force as you cut through the apple. \nIn movies and games, assassins and other characters who use knives may hold them with the blade facing down for these same reasons.

Quantity: A carton of beer contains 24 bottles, while you are only buying four wine glasses. When you buy in larger quantities, the cost per unit (in this case, per bottle or per glass) is often lower. \n2. Materials: Wine glasses are typically made from materials like glass or crystal, which can be more expensive to produce than the materials used to make beer bottles (such as glass or aluminum). \n3. Brand: The specific brand of wine glasses and beer that you are comparing might also have an impact on the price. Some brands are known for using higher-quality materials or have a more premium image, which can result in higher prices. \n4. Production and distribution costs: The process of producing and distributing wine and beer also involves different costs.

The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him \/ her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric \/ hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile . The forensic utility of profiling is still questioned and it 's important for people to realize that these profiles are merely educated guesses and law enforcement should not eliminate or ignore suspects who do n't fit the suspected profile . Source : Degree in Psychology & Criminology .","Most of the traditional \" real - life \" FBI profiles are more demographic - based than psychology - based . That is , they figured out that most rapists and other predatory sexual criminals started at around X age , grew more criminally sophisticated ( and often more violent ) as they committed more crimes , had certain types of experiences and behaviors in their background ( abuse , neglect , voyeuristic behavior , violence toward animals ) , etc . Based on that data they 're able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background \/ living situation , and so on .

If the crime scene is haphazard or disorganized , they may surmise that the killer is less experienced and probably younger , while a \" neater \" crime scene indicates someone who 's been at it for a while . The real misconception about profiling in terms of how it 's portrayed in popular culture , I think , is that it 's often shown as a more intuitive process , which only certain hyper - imaginative \/ hyper - empathetic individuals are able to carry out .

Therefore in some industries there is a lot of pressure on workers to join unions . If you look around you 'll find stories of strong - arm tactics or even open hostility . Employers also find unions difficult to work with . An employer needs to consider the financial situation of their company when considering things like wages , the union does n't have the same concern and so could make demands greater than the employer can cover , if the employer does n't meet the demands or negotiate them down then they risk their staff going on strike . The pro - union counterargument is that without unions the employers will have minimal pressure to actually raise wages , and that factors such as workplace favouritism could end up with two employees doing the same work for different amounts of pay , therefore it is better to have the employer and the union negotiate the wage for everyone ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Unions are organizations that workers can join to advocate for better working conditions, wages, and benefits.

How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client ’s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection .

If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here .

{"question":"How did pirates \/ navy track down other ships back before radar \/ sonar ? I wondered this while watching Pirates of the Caribbean and wondered how ships chased each other down ? It 's not possible to track steps through ocean . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["they really did nt . But often you knew where ships were likely to be . There are only so many ports , and the bigger a ship the bigger a port it needs to be able to dock . A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target . Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port . A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing . Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck . Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .","The ocean is endless but interesting places are not . I 'll assume here that the sail is n't on the horizon and we 're starting from scratch . Write a letter to everyone you know to every possible port and ship your target might encounter . Then make copies . Leave the letters for the packets to pick up . Packets were small , robust , but fairly fast ships that were the stagecoaches of the day . Part bus , part mail service , and always smelly and cramped . The packets would run a route picking up your letters and dropping them off at the destinations . Some packets would n't make it or the mail would simply be destroyed enroute . Which is why you made copies . Other times the packet would leave a letter in every port intended for a specific ship . Which is why you made copies . With luck and few weeks or a few months later the letters would be read . Your friends write back and describe the condition of the ship , where it was seen , and what activity it may be up to . Which you 'll read weeks or months later . However now you have a reasonable idea where to start the search . If the ship has weed on the hull then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's rigging is old and frayed then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's sails are thin and patched then it will be slow and easier to catch . So now you have an estimate of the speed . Then does the ship have enough water ? Is the ship using gunpowder excessively or conservatively ? Now you can start to guess how well supplied the ship is . This gives an idea of intent . Once the search region is known then it 's all about guessing where the ship will head next . Does the ship head for fresh water ? Does the ship head to a port for food or supplies ? Does the ship head to sea for mischief ? There are only so many interesting places to go . The most direct routes between these places form routes . Guess the destination and either get there first or attempt to intercept the ship at sea between destinations . Wait for days or weeks . Guess right and the sail should appear on the horizon . Now the chase begins . The winner is the faster ship or the one that does n't make the mistake . Luck , such as with the weather gauge , plays a huge factor on who chases whom . Guess wrong and spend the next few weeks or months repeating the process .","Trade routes . Highways on the sea . Ships were flagged with country and company . Most had predictible routes , left at predictible times(on the tide ) and had predictible cargos ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Before radar and sonar were invented, pirates and navies used a variety of methods to track down other ships. One common method was to use visual clues, such as looking for the sails or smoke from the ship's chimney. They might also use telescopes or other instruments to help them spot ships at a distance. \nAnother method was to use the stars and other celestial bodies as navigation aids. By looking at the position of the stars and other celestial objects, sailors could determine their own location and the direction they were heading.

{"question":"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Mixing light together is simple addition . Adding red light to green light gives you yellow light , add in blue and get white light . Paint , on the other hand , is about absorption and reflection . Yellow paint absorbs blue light , and reflects red and green . Red paint absorbs green and blue light , and reflects red . Mix them together and you get a paint that absorbs blue light , absorbs half of green light and reflects the other half , and reflects red : orange paint .","Sources of light use what 's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources . Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light . Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model . In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined , think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect .","The light you see is a result of what light is being reflected by an object . So if you shine green with red , you see yellow in light . But paints differ in the color they absorb . So mixing red ( which absorbs blue and yellow lights but reflects red ) and green ( which absorbs red and reflects blue and yellow ) together gives you something that absorbs red , blue , and yellow . If they were perfectly opposed , you 'd make black . Instead , you usually end up with brown because the two paints are n't diametrically opposed ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Mixing different colors of light actually does result in a different color, just like mixing paint does. The difference is in how our eyes and brains interpret the colors. \nWhen you mix two colors of paint together, the pigments in the paint absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. For example, red paint reflects red light and absorbs other colors. When you mix red and green paint together, the resulting color is a brownish color because the pigments in the paint are absorbing all of the colors of light except for brown. \nOn the other hand, when you mix two colors of light together, like red and green, the resulting color is a bright yellow because the light is actually adding together. This is because light is made up of different wavelengths of energy, and when you mix two colors of light together, you are adding the wavelengths of energy together. \nSo, the reason why mixing paint results in a different color than mixing light is because paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while light adds different wavelengths of energy together."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

{"question":"The differences between flash and HTML5 Which one is better for me as a user ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["They are really quite different . HTML is the language that websites are written in . It describes what elements are in the page and how they 're organized ( elements such as text , images , buttons and links ) . However , HTML originally did n't include the ability to show graphics , animations or videos ( other than pre - rendered images and animated gifs ) . HTML did provide the ability to include embedded objects , which would require the user to install a plugin that could display them . One such common plugin was Flash , which was basically another small program that runs inside your browser ( another such plugin is Java which can display Java Applets , but they 're hardly in use anymore ) . So developers could use Flash to create things like games ( such as the ones you 'll find in URL_0 ) and video players ( such as YouTube ) . HTML5 introduces new features to HTML , mainly the support for the < canvas > and < video > elements . These tags could be used to display graphics and videos without the need for an external plugin , and were handled by the browser and not by the plugin . HTML5 introduces many other new features , but these are the ones that are most relevant to this discussion ( HTML5 vs Flash ) . The main advantage of HTML5 is that it 's a standard that 's supported ( or should be supported ) by every browser . On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser . Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .","Essentially Flash is a product , whereas HTML5 is an open standard agreed upon by the internet 's \" governing body \" .

IMO ( as a Solution Architect - a person who designs large scale software systems ) and former software engineer and web developer HTML5 is far superior .

HTML5 is a version of the HTML programming language that is used to create the structure and layout of websites and web applications. \nAs a user, it's important to know that Flash and HTML5 are not directly competing technologies. They are simply two different ways of creating and displaying content on the internet, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. \nHere are some key differences between Flash and HTML5: \nCompatibility: Flash requires a separate plug-in to be installed in your web browser in order to work, while HTML5 is built into most modern browsers and does not require any additional software. This means that HTML5 content is generally more widely compatible and can be accessed on a wider range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.\nPerformance: HTML5 content tends to perform better than Flash content, especially on mobile devices. This is because HTML5 content is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while Flash content can be more resource-intensive and may not run as smoothly on some devices.\nSecurity: Flash has a reputation for being less secure than HTML5, as it is more susceptible to malware and other types of online threats. HTML5, on the other hand, has built-in security features that help to protect against these types of threats. \nUltimately, which technology is \"better\" for you as a user will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

And the location that they chose in Florida had a lot to do with the fact that there was n't anything there . You go there today and you do n't see it , but Brevard County in the 1940s was a bunch of orchards and hardly anything else . And this island that they 're on [ Merritt Island ] had good logistics , because there was a navy base and an army base not too far away . But there was no population density whatsoever .

This is one of the problems that [ the Soviet Union ] had with Baikonur [ Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan ] , their launch site . I mean , it is in the middle of nowhere . They had to build a whole infrastructure to run rail out there , to build highways , to bring in all of the water and power and everything else that was necessary to make that place habitable .

One reason is because Florida is close to the equator, which makes it easier to launch rockets into space. This is because the Earth's rotation is faster at the equator, which means that rockets can get a little extra \"boost\" when they launch. \nAnother reason is because Florida has a long history with space travel. The first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, launched into space from Florida in 1961. Since then, many other important space missions have launched from Florida, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and the space shuttle program. \nFinally, Florida has a lot of open space and good weather, which makes it a good place to test and launch rockets.

I 'm from New York . You 've gotten some good answers , but maybe I can help go more in - depth . The very first thing to remember is that in more expensive cities , wages rise with cost inflation . Now , it 's not a perfect scale-- most of the cost inflation comes because many people are * very * rich , not necessarily because the poor are less poor . However , it 's still a factor-- there are fewer minimum wage jobs , and\/or you 're more likely to get a job whose wages are above the federal minimum . In other words , chances are the same job netting you $ 7.25 in Nebraska will get you around $ 10 in NYC . Now that 's not 100 % true . There are still * some * minimum wage jobs here . How do people get by ? Well , about like anywhere else , I suppose . They do n't get to enjoy many aspects of the city where inflation has taken hold . They do n't get to go out to dinner at the nice restaurants or go drinking in NYC bars . They ca n't go to Whole Foods , they have to go to cheaper grocery stores . They have to curb themselves more , and * * they get government assistance * * like anywhere else . Remember , the farther you go from NYC the cheaper things get , so many times people will live far away from the city if they do n't make a lot . And if they 're living far away from the city , and working a minimum wage job ... they can just as easily find one near where they live .

Matter of fact I ca n't think of a single minimum wage job I 've had , and I 've made the rounds as a student . Office worker , busboy , waiter , receptionist ... they all paid around $ 10 . And one last thing to remember : The cost of living does n't * have * to be high in this city . It 's totally doable on less money . The reason it seems higher is that it * can * be higher . And most people making very little tend to have a social circle where people make standard ( remember how I said there are n't many minimum wage jobs here ?

{"question":"Why do n't multi winged planes work ? [ Planes like this ] ( URL_0 ) alternatively why do planes typically have two or four wings ?

Essentially it comes down to this : you want to create as much lift as possible , for as little drag as possible , using the smallest amount of weight possible . And , of course , it has to be structurally sound . The plane in the picture would probably collapse . The wings are creating drag , so they are all being pushed backward , and those skinny pylons would likely break . On top of that , the drag would be trying to tip the plane backward . Even if it was strong enough , it would n't fly well , if at all . Multiple wings do work , and did for all of WWI , but a more powerful engine , a stronger single wing , and a swept back wing shape are all designed for strength and efficiency . The most efficient design is two long skinny wings , but material strength has n't quite made that possible for commercial use .","It 's not so much that they ca n't work , but rather that there 's no need . Your question is sort of like asking why do n't cars have 8 wheels . Early airplane prototypes lacked solid aerodynamic information for how to design wings and , as a result , had very inefficient wings ( very little lift generated ) . Rather than redesign the wings , many early aviators simply tried adding more wings . Of course , the problem with this was making sure that the structure to support all the wings was strong enough , which it often was n't . For example , here 's some newsreel footage of the same plane in the image you linked ( the [ Gerhardt Cycleplane ] ( URL_1 ) ): URL_0 Once aerodynamics were more well - understood , the need for multiple wings declined and eventually disappeared . It 's also worth noting that planes with multiple sets of wings can have problems if one set produces much more lift than the others . The Fokker Dr. I ( better known as simply the \" Fokker Triplane \" or the \" Red Baron 's plane \" ) , for example , had problems with the top wing producing so much more lift than the other two wings that the top wing would rip itself off of the aircraft at high speeds . This behavior tended to cause problems and was one of many reasons why , despite its prevalence in popular lore , the Dr. I saw only limited use in actual combat . So , the short answer to your question is that , with our ability to generate more than enough lift with a single set of wings , the need for multiple sets of wings has passed ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Planes with multiple wings, like the one in the image you provided, are called \"multiplane\" or \"sesquiplane\" designs. These designs were experimented with in the early days of aviation, but they were not widely used because they did not perform as well as planes with fewer wings. \nThere are several reasons why planes with multiple wings are not typically used. One reason is that they are more complex and expensive to build than planes with fewer wings. They also tend to be heavier and less efficient, which means that they require more power to fly and use more fuel. \nPlanes with two wings, or \"biplanes,\" were the most common design in the early days of aviation. They are still used today in some specialty applications, such as crop dusting or airshows. Most modern planes, however, have a single, long wing called a \"monoplane.\" This design is more aerodynamic and efficient, and it allows the plane to fly faster and further than a biplane. \nFour-winged planes, or \"quadruplanes,\" have also been experimented with, but they have not been widely used because they do not offer significant advantages over other designs. \nOverall, the number of wings on an airplane is determined by a combination of factors, including the size and weight of the plane, the type of mission it will be used for, and the desired performance characteristics. Engineers and designers carefully consider these factors when designing a new plane to ensure that it is safe, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of its intended use."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

Something has to specifically select _ against _ the useless feature . If having wisdom teeth made people less attractive , or raised the likelihood of them dying before reproducing , then we could postulate that there would be evolutionary pressure against larger wisdom teeth and that , over time , more and more people with smaller wisdom teeth would be selected , leading to a gradual evolutionary decline in wisdom teeth .

{"question":"Why are all these police officers standing in front of a grand jury rather than facing a normal trial ? Also , what is the difference between a grand jury and a normal jury ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Going to a grand jury * is * part of a normal trial ( at least for some kinds of cases ; it varies by state ) . A grand jury is a group of people that the prosecutor has to convince he has a case . He does n't have to prove that the defendant is guilty , just that there 's enough evidence that it 's OK to bring charges against them . The idea here is that the trial itself should not be inflicted upon someone who is obviously innocent — bringing charges must not be a weapon against innocent charges . Charging innocent people can still happen , but this step is intended to minimize it . The controversy is that generally grand juries are very easy to convince and many see them as a formality more than anything . When a high profile case does n't get an indictment ( i.e. a formal accusation against someone that a crime was committed ; pronounced in - dight - ment ) it raises a question of whether the prosecutor was really trying to get the grand jury to indict . Many feel that even though the officer in the Ferguson case would likely have been found innocent that it was not the prosecutor 's place to present such a weak case to the grand jury in order to stop the case then and there .","The constitution says : > No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger In otherwords : Someone accused of committing murder has to have a Grand Jury say there 's probable cause for a trial . So : Step 1 : Grand Jury : is there enough evidence to have a trial for murder . Step 2 : Regular Jury : is he guilty of murder ? You do n't hear about Grand Juries because in over 99 % of cases brought , Grand Juries indict . Partially , because you only need 12 of 16 - 23 members to support indictment . At the federal level , [ 538 reports ] ( URL_0 ) 161,989 of 162,000 federal grand juries indict .","The grand jury is a preliminary proceeding for the purpose of deciding whether there is a good enough reason to have a trial . The difference between a grand jury and a normal jury ( i.e. , a trial ) is that a grand jury is a closed , one - sided hearing where the prosecutor is tasked with demonstrating that there is probable cause to believe that a defendant committed the particular crime . Usually , a two - thirds supermajority agreement among the jurors is required to \" indict \" the defendant ( i.e. , two - thirds of the jurors must agree that there exists probable cause to believe the defendant committed a crime , thus warranting a full trial ) . If two - thirds of the jurors indict the defendant , it does not mean he is convicted . It means there is enough evidence that there should be a full trial . Unlike during the grand jury , at a full trial the defendant enjoys his sixth amendment rights to counsel , to confront his accusers , and to a public proceeding . What I mean is that during a grand jury the defendant has no right to call his own witnesses , nor cross - examine witnesses that testify against him ( or more accurately have a lawyer do those things ) , and he has no right to public oversight . During a trial the defendant has a right to a lawyer , who can introduce evidence and call witnesses on his behalf and cross - examine opposing witnesses in an a hearing opened to public oversight . Also , the trial requires the jury to unanimously vote that he committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict him . This is a much harder standard than the grand jury 's 2\/3 's majority vote for probable cause . It 's also worth noting that not all states employ grand juries . For example , in my state a preliminary hearing substitutes for the grand jury . During my state 's preliminary hearings , the prosecutor is tasked with introducing evidence before a judge ( without a jury ) , and the defendant has the right to have a lawyer argue against that evidence and cross examine the prosecutor 's witnesses . In this scenario the judge ( and not a jury ) decides whether there is enough probable cause for the case to go to trial . This is not to say that some states only do grand juries , and other states only do preliminary hearings . My state has certain policies where it will use a grand jury rather than a preliminary hearing , e.g. , where there is a danger of witness intimidation . I do n't know whether my state would use a grand jury for a capital case against a cop . Technically it would be at the District Attorney 's discretion , but it 's probably really just politics . Also , it should be noted that the rules regarding whether or not there must be a grand jury is different in federal courts . The fifth amendment preserves a defendant 's right to a grand jury for all \" capital , or otherwise infamous crime[s ] \" in federal courts . To sum it up , a grand jury is a process with a very low burden of proof for the purpose of deciding whether a full trial is necessary . Some states use preliminary hearings more often .

One difference is that grand juries don't decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty. Their job is only to decide if there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime.

Tires also have a sidewall, which is the part of the tire that you can see between the tread and the wheel. The sidewall has important information printed on it, like the size of the tire and the maximum load and speed it can handle. \nNow, let's talk about some of the factors that can make one tire better than another: \n1. Performance: Some tires are designed for specific types of driving or weather conditions. For example, you might want a tire with a softer compound for better grip on a race track, or a tire with a lot of tread for better traction in the rain. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions tend to cost more because they require more advanced materials and engineering. \n2. Quality: Tires can also vary in terms of quality, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Higher-quality tires are typically made with better materials and more advanced manufacturing processes, which can make them last longer and perform better. These tires tend to cost more, but they can save you money in the long run because you won't have to replace them as often. \n3. Brand: The brand of the tire can also affect the price. Some tire brands are known for making high-quality, high-performance tires that come with a higher price tag. Other brands might offer more budget-friendly options that may not have the same level of performance or quality. \nSo, to sum it up: tires can vary in price based on their performance, quality, and brand.

The upfronts usually take place in May, and the new TV seasons begin in September. This allows the networks to promote their new shows to a large audience over the summer, so that people will be more likely to watch when the new seasons begin. \nThere are a few reasons why it might make sense for some shows to come out in the spring or summer instead. For one thing, there is typically less competition for viewership during these times of year, since there are fewer new shows premiering. This can be especially helpful for shows that are trying to establish a strong following and might get lost in the shuffle during the crowded fall season. Additionally, the weather is generally nicer in the spring and summer, which can make it a more appealing time for people to sit down and watch TV. \nOverall, it really depends on the show and what the creators and networks think will be the best time for it to be released.

Here are a few reasons why: \n1. Density: Water is much denser than air, so when a spacecraft falls into it from a high altitude, it will experience much more resistance and deceleration. This could cause the spacecraft to break apart or sustain serious damage upon impact. \n2. Depth: Lakes are typically not very deep, so if a spacecraft were to land in one, it would have to do so at a very low altitude. This would not give the spacecraft enough time to slow down and make a safe landing. \n3. Control: When a spacecraft returns to Earth, it needs to be able to control its descent and land in a specific location. This is not possible when landing in a lake, as the spacecraft would be at the mercy of the wind and currents. \n4. Recovery: Finally, it would be very difficult to recover a spacecraft that has landed in a lake. Specialized equipment would be needed to lift it out of the water, which could be time-consuming and costly. \nIn summary, landing a spacecraft in a lake is not a safe or practical option. Instead, spacecraft are designed to land on solid ground, where they can touch down at a controlled speed and be easily recovered."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

{"question":"Can US ever repay its national debt ? Is it possible to ever get the 17 or so trillion dollar debt back to 0 and how so ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , \" yes , but you would n't really want to \" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .","Yeah , you could , but it would be immensely stupid , given that the value of money always drops due to inflation .

Think of electricity as water in a hose . In this analogy , the current ( measured in amperes ) would be analogous to current of the water through the pipe- as in , how much water moves through a given section in a period of time . Voltage would be the speed of the water both in the hose and coming out the end of the hose . How does this help us understand transformers ? Let 's say you want to increase the voltage of the electricity . This can be done without having to raise the power supply at all , using what 's called a transformer . Put your thumb over the end of the hose- suddenly the water starts shooting out , and you can feel the increase of pressure under your thumb . The amount of water passing through any given section of the hose at any point in time has not changed at all , but by shrinking the opening with your thumb , in order to keep the current constant , the water has to speed up coming out the end , which lets you [ spray your backyard enemies ] ( URL_1 ) with a more effective water laser .

Take a piece of metal ( your transformer 's \" core \" ) and wrap your wires around it like [ this . ] ( URL_0 ) ( Please note that the transformer setup in this diagram would do the opposite , and * decrease * the voltage ) All moving electric charges ( in this case , the electrons moving through the wire wrapped around the left side of the core ) create a magnetic field . As you can see , the left side has fewer turns than the right side . The electrons in the wire on the right are influenced by the magnetic field created by the ones on the left , and they begin moving . This creates an \" induced \" current in the right side . Energy must be conserved ! Because there are more coils on the right , there are more electrons under the influence than you started with ! So the voltage decreases ( or increases ) based on how many turns of wire are wrapped around each side . Unfortunately , there is one discrepancy with the hose analogy- the current in the wire has to increase if the voltage decreases , ( so that energy is conserved across the transformer ) and vise versa . The core plays a pretty important role , too ! It magnifies the electromagnetic effects because it is full of electrons that mimic the ones in the wire . Does that help ? ( It 's been a looong time since undergrad so if I 've bungled it anyone is welcome to correct me )","Magnetic fields induce voltage into conductors ( like copper wire ) . To increase a magnetic field , one trick is to coil copper wire . The flow of electricity creates a magnetic field along the length of the wire , but it is relatively weak . If you coil the wire , the field compounds it 's effects and changes it 's magnetic flow to be around the entire coil instead of the wire alone . Certain materials are also used to further increase magnetism by allowing magnetic field lines to move . Like electricity , magnetic field flux lines move through materials differently . Magnetic field flow is called reluctance . Iron is very reluctant , and allows the magnet field lines to become stronger . Placing an iron core inside a coil increases the magnetic field strength , which increases the ability it has to induce voltage into a nearby copper conductor . Smaller coil , higher voltage , next to a large coil , and you 've stepped down the voltage , but what you lose in volts has become amperage .

It does this by using coils of wire and a magnetic field. \nInside a transformer, there are two coils of wire called the primary coil and the secondary coil. The primary coil is connected to a source of electricity, such as a power outlet, and the secondary coil is connected to a device that needs electricity, such as a lamp. \nWhen electricity flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field around the coil. This magnetic field then causes a current to flow in the secondary coil, which creates its own magnetic field. The two magnetic fields interact with each other, causing energy to be transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil. \nThe amount of energy that is transferred depends on the number of coils in each of the primary and secondary coils. If the secondary coil has fewer coils than the primary coil, it will receive less energy, which means the voltage of the electricity in the secondary circuit will be lower than the voltage in the primary circuit.

For example, parrots can move their tongue and beak to shape the sounds they produce, just like humans do with their lips and tongue when they speak. \nIt's also important to note that parrots are highly intelligent and have a strong ability to learn and imitate sounds, which is why they are able to mimic human speech and other sounds so well.

However, here are a few potential reasons that might explain why some celebrities might be drawn to Scientology: \n1. The promise of personal and professional growth: The Church of Scientology claims to offer a path to personal and professional development through its spiritual teachings and practices. Some celebrities may find these teachings appealing and believe that they can help them achieve success and happiness. \n2. The sense of community: The Church of Scientology is known for its tight-knit community, and some celebrities may find the support and fellowship of this community appealing. \n3. The celebrity connection: Some celebrities may be drawn to the Church of Scientology simply because other celebrities are involved with it. Being part of a group that includes other successful and famous people can be attractive to some. \n4.

As we all know the NFL is the king of this as they go to commercial after every change of possession ( sometimes twice like on a kickoff ) . This results in tons of commercialization of the game . The NBA is similar since there are so many timeouts and the MLB is predictable with its innings so it can go to commercial multiple times . The NHL is n't as popular in the USA . This is somewhat a result of the lack of commercials like in soccer which also has not caught on in America . Boxing and MMA do not fit the American model of a commercial sport ."],"chatgpt_answers":["In general, major sporting events like football and basketball games are free to watch on TV because they are broadcast by networks that have paid for the rights to show the games. These networks make money by selling advertisements during the broadcasts. \nOn the other hand, many boxing and MMA events are pay-per-view (PPV) events, which means that people have to pay to watch them on TV. This is because the organizers of these events have made arrangements with cable and satellite companies to show the events on PPV, and the money from the PPV fees goes to the organizers and the fighters. \nOne reason that boxing and MMA events might be more likely to be PPV is that they tend to be less popular than football and basketball, and therefore don't attract as many viewers or as much advertising money. As a result, the organizers of these events may need to charge a fee in order to cover their costs and make a profit."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"Where did this 1 in front of phone numbers come from ? ? ? I just noticed that every phone number has them now , why do we do that ? ? And when did it start ? ? ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["+1 is the international country code for the US and Canada . As long as you 're not actually making an international call it 's unnecessary .","That 1 is the [ country code ] ( URL_0 ) for North America . It 's been part of dialing for decades . In the old days , you used to just dial 7 digits ( 555 - 1234 ) and it assumed you were calling something local ( in your area code ) . Calling outside your area code required 1 + area code + 7 digits ( e.g. 1 - 555 - 5555 ) . After a while , that fell apart . As cities grew larger & people started getting multiple numbers ( fax lines , cell phones , etc ) we did n't have enough room in an area code for all the people that were actually \" local \" to each other . We switched to mandatory 10 - digit dialing for even local calls . These days , many people have cell phones that are n't \" local \" to where they 're living so they ca n't do naked 10 - digit dialing of \" local \" calls . It 's always been there , people are just writing it down more frequently . If you look at numbers in Europe , people almost * always * write down the country code with their numbers . For example , the Conde Nast European office is listed as * * +44 20 7499 9080 * * but UK callers wo n't need the 44 .","The reason for the 1 is that the phone system needs to know when you 're finished dialing based only on the numbers you 've dialed so far . If you start with some number other than 1 , then it knows you 're dialing only seven digits . If it starts with 1 , then it knows that you 're dialing ten more digits , so it does n't start trying to connect the call after the first seven . This is n't an issue with cell phones , where you send the whole number in at once , but older phones it would send each digit to the phone system as you dialed or pressed the digit ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The 1 in front of phone numbers is called a country code, and it is used to identify which country a phone number belongs to. This is especially important when making international phone calls, because it helps the phone system route the call to the correct country. \nThe use of country codes for phone numbers started when telephone systems were first developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. At that time, each country had its own telephone system, and it was important to be able to distinguish between different countries when making phone calls. The 1 in front of phone numbers in the United States is the country code for the United States, and it is used to identify phone numbers in the United States when making international phone calls. \nThe country code is typically followed by an area code, which is used to identify a specific region or city within a country. The area code is followed by the local phone number, which is used to identify a specific phone line within a region or city. For example, if you want to call a phone number in the United States, you would dial 1 (the country code for the United States), followed by the area code (which might be something like 212 for New York City), followed by the local phone number (which might be something like 555-1212). \nI hope that helps!

The deal with nicotine ( smoking tobacco ) is this ... while it is definitely addictive , its effects are not socially destructive , as the effects of alcohol , or cocaine , or heroin ( or whatever ) . Nicotine definitely is hazardous to one 's health ( and even to others in the form of second - hand smoke ) , but its effects are mostly personal and take a relatively long time to show up .

In these cases, quitting both drugs and alcohol is necessary for successful recovery. \nAs for smoking cigarettes, while it is not strictly prohibited for recovering drug addicts, it is generally not recommended because smoking can also have negative health consequences and may be a trigger for drug or alcohol use.

It is usually found in areas where the water pressure in the local water pipes is not strong enough to deliver water to buildings and homes. \nThe water tower helps to solve this problem by storing a large amount of water at a higher elevation than the buildings and homes. This allows the water to flow downward, through the pipes, and into the buildings and homes under the force of gravity. This is called \"gravity feed.\" \nWater towers also help to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes. When a lot of water is being used at the same time (for example, when people are taking showers or flushing toilets), the water pressure can drop. Having a water tower helps to ensure that there is always a reserve of water available to meet the demand, so the water pressure stays stable. \nIn summary, water towers are used to store water and to help with the delivery of water to buildings and homes, as well as to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

{"question":"why do men orgasm faster when women have more nerve endings in their genitals Why is this Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Men are also not faster to climax than women ; it takes women the same amount of time to orgasm during masturbation as it takes men , on average , to have an orgasm through intercourse : five to ten minutes . The focus on men ’s internal wants and sensations also draws our attention to his satisfaction . Thus his orgasm , but not necessarily hers , becomes a critical part of what must happen for a sexual encounter to be successful and fulfilling . This is part of why intercourse – a sexual act that is strongly correlated with orgasm for men – is the only act that almost everyone agrees counts as “ real sex , ” whereas activities that are more likely to produce orgasm in women are considered optional foreplay .

The Mona Lisa is a portrait of a woman and is known for the enigmatic smile on her face, which is one of the reasons it is so famous. \nOne of the things that makes the Mona Lisa so special is the way Leonardo painted the woman's face and expression. He used a technique called sfumato, which involves blending the colors and tones of the paint so that there are no hard edges or lines. This gives the painting a very soft and natural look, as if the woman is almost alive. \nAnother reason the Mona Lisa is so highly regarded is because of the detail and care that Leonardo put into the painting. He spent many years working on the Mona Lisa, and it shows in the level of detail in the painting. From the folds of the woman's dress to the landscape in the background, everything is carefully and beautifully rendered. \nOverall, the Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece because of the skill and attention to detail that Leonardo put into the painting, as well as the way he used color and technique to create a sense of depth and realism. It is a beautiful and timeless work of art that has inspired and delighted people for centuries."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

{"question":"How do herbivores like wild horses acquire so much muscle mass just by feeding on grass ? Can a vegan human maintain high muscle mass just by feeding on herbs ? and if no why not ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Horses are naturally herbivores . There is protein in what they eat , although the protein density is low , so they have to eat a lot of it . The digestive tract of an herbivore is different from a human 's , allowing them to process that volume of plant matter quickly and without using much energy , and also getting nutrients from it that human 's ca n't . For a vegan human to have a lot of muscle mass is possible , but more difficult . Mainly , they have to focus on eating high protein plants like nuts and beans .","Different species are able to synthesize different nutrients themselves through cellular processes . Nutrients include carbohydrates , fats , proteins ( or their building blocks , amino acids ) , and vitamins . This means instead of the body having to \" eat \" the protein containing a particular amino acid , the cell itself can make that amnio acid . This of course requires energy and work by the cell . Conversely , \" a nutrient is said to be \" essential \" if it must be obtained from an external source , either because the organism can not synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities \" . So there are two kinds of nutrients , those that we can make through our own cellular processes , and those we must obtain through our diet . [ Proteins ] ( URL_2 ) are made up of different [ amnio acids ] ( URL_3 ) . A good analogy is that a protein is like a train , and the individual cars are amnio - acids . Different combinations of railcars , in different orders give different kinds of trains . In the same way , different amnio - acids , in different combinations give different kinds of proteins . Digestion , be it in animals or humans , results in the breakdown proteins into their amnio acid components . The intestine absorbs the individual amnio acids and the body ships these amnio acids to the cells . Cellular processes rearrange the amnio acids in new ways to make new proteins that are used by the animal or human for various bodily functions . So think of the cell as the railyard where new trains ( proteins ) are made but reassembling the cars ( amnio - acids ) into new and different combinations . \" Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms , including catalyzing metabolic reactions , replicating DNA , responding to stimuli , and transporting molecules from one location to another . \" There are [ nine essential amino acids ] ( URL_1 ) that humans must consume in their diet because our cells can not make them through cellular processes . The rest we can make ourselves in our cells . This means that our diet must meet these minimum essential amnio acids requirements in order for us to survive . We can not make the nine , we must consume the nine . The nine are found in all kinds of foods , from plants to meat which is why humans can have such a wide variety of diets ( e.g. vegetarian , vegan , allergen - accomidating ) and still function normally . However , other animals have different essential nutritional requirements . For example , [ cats , unlike humans , can not synthesize the amino acid taurine so it must be added to their diet ] ( URL_0 ) . Some species are able to synthesize Vitamin C and do not need to consume it in their diet ( e.g. mice ) , whereas humans can not synthesize Vitamin C and thus are required to consume it in our diet . These differences in essential nutrient intake creates different dietary requirements for different species and results in different types of foods being consumed preferentially by different species . This is why a horse is able to survive and thrive just on plant material , whereas we are required to consume a more varied diet . They obtain all their unique essential nutrients from their herbivore diet . So other species have different combinations of essential nutrients in order to sustain a balanced and healthy diet . This makes perfect sense , if all species had the exact same requirements there would be a lot of competition for the same food resources . By diversifying what is essential to consume , there is less competition . Remember that it is costly for the body to produce its own nutrients through cellular processes . It is much easier to just consume an amnio acid than produce it . Thus , if a particular amino acid or nutrient is abundant and easily available in a species environment it makes more sense for natural selection to select against the cell 's producing that nutrient , and for the individual to simply consume it . For example , most primates - including humans - do not synthesize vitamin C. This makes perfect sense since vitamin C is easily acquired through our collective diets by consuming fruit . Fruit is abundant resource in most primate 's environments thus vitamin C would not be hard to acquire . So each species is balancing what they need to eat , and what they can produce themselves , along with what is available to them in their environment .","Herbivores have multiple stomachs with different enzymes that allow them to extract nutrition from fiber . Humans do not . Plus herbivores eat for up to half their lives , chomping on uncooked grasses and such . They did a test where some humans were given a diet equivalent to a gorilla , for a week . They spent ~8 hours chomping on raw vegetables , and by the end they were lethargic and malnourished . The human body simply ca n't sustain itself on raw vegetables . We evolved through cooking an omnivorous diet ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Herbivores like wild horses can acquire a lot of muscle mass by eating a lot of grass because grass contains a good amount of nutrients that the body needs to grow and maintain muscle mass. These nutrients include proteins, which are important for building and repairing muscle tissue, and carbohydrates, which provide the body with energy to support physical activity. \nIt is possible for a vegan human to maintain high muscle mass by eating a varied and balanced diet that includes a good source of plant-based proteins and carbohydrates. Some examples of plant-based proteins that can help build and maintain muscle mass include beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, and seeds. It is also important for vegans to make sure they are getting enough calories and nutrients from other sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to support muscle growth and maintenance. \nHowever, it is generally easier for people who eat animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy, to get enough protein and other nutrients to support muscle mass because these sources of protein are typically more easily digestible and contain a more complete set of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. This does not mean that it is impossible for vegans to maintain high muscle mass, but it may require more careful planning and attention to nutrition."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

{"question":"How is it that we know how an atom looks like ? I mean is it still just a guess ? Or is there actually a way for us to see how an atom looks like ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["It is a theoretical model , that has been proven through experiment . Imagine someone gives you a gift . It is a hollow metal sphere but it is packaged in a box . You have no idea what the gift is , but decide to do some experiments to find out , without actually opening the box . First you shake the box and it moves around . This tells you it is relatively light . Then , knowing that it is light , you move it slowly and you feel it rolling . This tells you that it is probably round . Now you are trying to find out what it is made of . You apply heat to the box , then shake to see if it has melted but it has not . You suspect that it is a strong but light material , like a metal alloy - since initial shake tests did n't break it ca n't be brittle . So you decide to touch magnets to the surface of the box . The object does not move and stays attracted to the magnet . This tells you it is metallic . Since it is metallic and relatively light , you suspect , it is hollow . So , you poke a hole in the box , and fill it with water . Comparing the volume of the box , with the volume of water you filled will tell you the size of the object . From this , you can choose a metal - alloy based on the magnetic strength recorded and estimate how hollow it is . All this has been concluded , without actually seeing the sphere . Still , you can only speculate what colour the sphere is or whether it has dimples or not . But from the tests you carried out , you can pretty much acknowledge certain findings as fact . That 's sort of the process people like Rutherford used to determine the atomic model . As for being able to see it , I do n't think so . We have two types of microscope - Light microscope and Electron microscope . LM uses lightwaves ( duh ) and so objects too small to interfere with these waves can not be seen . EM uses electrons ( of course ) , which which are very tiny , and they bounce back of the object at different angles to give us awesome 3d images . I do n't need to tell you what would happen if we tried to fire electrons at an atom ... but that 's beside the point . The Rutherford experiments already did that , and it told us that materials are mostly empty space and there is much distance between the nucleus and an electron . So , you ca n't see the \" model \" of the atom , but you can see individual atoms using an TEM transmission electron microscope iirc .","We ca n't directly see an atom and in fact , depending on what you 're trying to do with an atom or what situation you 're looking at it , you could \" pretend \" an atom looks different .

When working with inorganic chemistry , we assume the most traditional model of the atom that you see with a nucleus and electrons .

Little things like officers not following departmental protocols time and time again after reported incidents of the use of extreme force ( e.g. not getting \/ recording post - incident interviews , failing to collect evidence ) without action taken by the chief or a political system have led to people simply losing faith in the police . Many feel that the entitlement is so rampant that the officers ca n't be trusted as they once were . It goes deeper than this too . There is a very real and deeply seated distrust between non - whites ( and sympathetic \/ empathetic whites ) and the justice system . Exacerbated by a failed war on drugs and the still tender wounds of the civil rights movement . ( That 's my explanation of the Police side of the issue but , like everything , there are two sides here ) As mentioned above , ours is a generation born of several decades of political strife , or at least our privileged \" first world problems \" version of it . From Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement to Rodney King and Katrina , you could say that protest and civil disobedience is in our blood . This has led to a public refusal to capitulate to authority and , for many , the automatic assumption that those with power are disinterested in the common good or even actively opressive . Law enforcement agencies , as a result , feel they are now in an arms race of sorts . Additional firepower and more agressive tactics have been , they feel , necessitated by a progressively more uncooperative ( and often better armed ) public . This in turn reenforces the public 's notions of opression . ( That is my ELI5 of the situation , the rest is my personal opinion on it ) You will hear often ( in fact a couple comments here reference it ) that these incidents are so infrequent that they hardly deserve attention , the current furor being nothing more than the direct result of news media sensationalization .

Undoubtedly it is a high standard perhaps unachievable but law enforcement is the tool through which we shape a better more idealized society . I firmly believe that we are only ever as righteous as the least righteous amongst us . Police departments have a responsibility to weed out the offending officers .

{"question":"Why do online videos stream flawlessly on my computer but why do GIFs seem to load like a 1080p movie through a 56k modem ? ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["tl;dr : GIF is an image compression format , which is n't really suited well to compressing video data . Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says \" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . \" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs \/ live video . I did n't try to explain DCT \/ Quantization \/ entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate \/ coding issues . I think it is safe to say that GIF is a terrible video compression format , and that 's probably the root of many other issues . However , I have n't profiled browsers to see where they spend time decoding animated GIFs . I made a list of other places that could be inefficient [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . - Yeah , your \" five year old did n't understand this \" el - oh - el :P If my 7 - yr - old had the interest I 'd try to explain it to him and get his feedback , but I think he 'd rather play LEGO . --- EDIT 2 : A couple more things people are asking \/ mentioning : - Several people have mentioned HTML5 Video and WebM as alternatives to animated GIFs . There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is \" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? \" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .","Short answer : videos use better compression techniques than GIFs . GIF was originally designed as a still image format , with the animation capability kind of shoehorned in later . Video uses compression techniques that were designed specifically for video . This means the file size of a GIF is much bigger than an equivalent video ( often 5x to 10x bigger ) , so it takes much longer to download . Long answer : Think of a GIF like a flipbook . It 's a series of still pictures that when played quickly , look like a video . You need to download each one of those still pictures . Each frame is compressed , but little is done to take advantage of the fact that one frame is probably very similar to the next frame ( there are some minor optimizations done though -- for instance if the background of a frame does n't change at all from one frame to the next , that background wo n't be sent to you every time ) . Video uses much better compression techniques . Each frame is compressed like in a GIF , but frames are also compared to the one before and the one after . Just like in a GIF , if the background does n't change it wo n't be sent to you every time . But there are also more clever things that can be done -- say a car is moving from left to right in your video . Video compressors will basically say \" hey that car that was over there in the last frame , just move it to the right 5 pixels \" . So you take the image of the car you already have , shift it to the right , and that 's your next frame . GIF ca n't do this . Since a lot of video consists of smooth motion similar to this , videos compress very well . This is called [ motion compensation ] ( URL_0 ) . There are a number of other issues at play here too : * The compression technology used by GIF is far older than modern video compression , so that the compression achieved by each individual frame is better with modern videos . The LZW compression technique used in GIF is 30 + years old , for instance . * GIF uses lossless compression , whereas most videos use [ lossy compression ] ( URL_1 ) -- basically the video compressor throws away data that you 're probably not going to notice anyway . And even if you do notice it , chances are it 's still good enough to get the point across . ( JPEG is another example of a lossy compression scheme that you 're probably familiar with . ) * Along with this , video compressors throw away some color information as well . This one is harder to explain easily , but basically your eye is better at noticing changes in brightness rather than changes in color . So the compressor looks at the brightness and color of every pixel . When it comes time to write out the video , it stores the brightness for every pixel , but only stores the color for every 4th pixel . The other 3 pixels share that same color . Hopefully that made some amount of sense . It 's called [ Chroma subsampling ] ( URL_2 ) if you 'd like to read more . All that adds up to better compression for video , which means smaller file sizes , which means faster downloads .

However, Italy's role in the war was not as significant as Germany's or Japan's. Germany was the main driving force behind the war and was responsible for many of the most heinous crimes committed during the conflict, such as the Holocaust, which resulted in the extermination of millions of Jews and other minority groups. Japan, on the other hand, was responsible for numerous war crimes in Asia, including the Nanjing Massacre, in which hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians were killed. \nAs a result, Germany and Japan have received more infamy and condemnation for their actions during the war. Italy, while it did participate in the war and committed its own crimes, has not received the same level of notoriety as these other two countries. \nIt's also important to note that after the war, both Germany and Japan underwent significant changes and have since become strong democratic countries.

{"question":"how did the first wealthy humans become wealthy ? Let 's say the first 1000 modern humans are hunting and gathering everyday . How did one guy become richer and start offering jobs , payment , etc ? What made him so special ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["There are a number of political theories on this . Locke would say that the first wealthy human earned his fortune through labour and intelligence , carving off a piece of the land and improving it through the generations such that it began to supply more value than he needed . Rousseau would say that the first wealthy man was the man who convinced others that he could ' own ' land . Prior to that , humanity lived in a state of noble savagery , where all men were afforded what their strength could win them . Marx would say that the first wealthy man was a soldier , who beat and enslaved a group of people to make the first poor people . The truth is probably somewhere in between all of these , or some other as yet unknown theory .","Wealth in the sense you 're using it does n't really exist in a hunter - gatherer society . When you 're wandering around after herds of animals or to seasonal campsites , you can only carry so much with you . Everyone in the society spends almost all their time on basic survival ; gathering food and making shelter . There is little specialization , so the ability to produce items of exceptional quality is very limited . You might have one chief who is in charge or organizes things , but this is more authority than wealth . It may be based on group consensus , physical strength , or hunting ability , but there is no way to accumulate stuff so as to be able to \" hire \" people . Wealth started with agriculture . Suddenly , not everyone had to be employed in the procurement of food 24\/7 . Also , people were stationary , so they could build solid houses and accumulate stuff . Specialization allowed individuals to become highly skilled at a particular job , and thus to produce items of significantly higher quality . It also allowed the development of technology such as metal working that produced items that had a high value . It was these people who were released from the need to devote themselves to basic survival that allowed for the development of a basic economy . Once that happened , people could accumulate wealth in the ways you typically would expect ( being the leader and taking stuff from others , being the best blacksmith and making great tools and weapons , being smart , etc . )","The concept of accumulating wealth would n't have come around until there was a resource worth accumulating and there was enough of a surplus of it to accumulate . You would also need the concept of possession \/ ownership . I doubt a hunter - gatherer society would have that pre - requisite concept ( ie . everything would be shared or discarded if unnecessary ) . If we are talking about things like number of children or relative decision - making power within the community as criteria of wealth , than maybe that context works for prehistoric societies . In the most basic context , wealth may have equalled power . The more power you have , the more likely you are to get the best things as they were gathered \/ hunted \/ made . There would have been little to nothing to accumulate though , so wealth was as temporary as your power . Modern wealth would have sprung up around the time when people settled down and formed civilizations . If you stay in one place , build a permanent home , and have the means to provide food and water to your family , than you have the opportunity to accumulate things beyond those necessities ."],"chatgpt_answers":["The first wealthy humans likely became wealthy through a combination of luck, hard work, and being in the right place at the right time. For example, let's say that one of the first 1000 modern humans discovered a new source of food, like a field full of ripe berries or a river full of fish. This person might have been able to gather more food than they needed, and they could have traded or sold the excess to other people in exchange for things they needed or wanted. \nOver time, this person might have become known as someone who had a lot of food, and others might have wanted to trade with them or work for them in order to get some of that food. This could have given the person more resources, which they could have used to do things like buy tools or hire others to work for them. \nAnother way that someone might have become wealthy was by inventing or discovering something new that was valuable to others. For example, if someone invented a new tool or technique that made it easier to hunt or gather food, they might have been able to trade or sell that invention to others in exchange for resources. \nUltimately, there are many factors that could have contributed to the first wealthy humans becoming wealthy, and it likely varied from person to person. Some people might have had natural talents or abilities that helped them succeed, while others might have had to work harder or be more creative in order to achieve their wealth."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

Plaque can build up in the blood vessels over time and can eventually rupture, causing a blood clot to form. If the blood clot is large enough, it can block the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack. \nIn some cases, heart attacks can be brought on by other factors, such as high blood pressure, smoking, or stress. However, they can also happen randomly, even in people who do not have any known risk factors for heart disease. \nIt is also possible for people to have more than one heart attack.

{"question":"Why does live TV look different from pre - filmed TV , even when they are broadcast at the same quality ? Case in point : 30 rock live episodes vs normal episodes . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["You have a lot of time to do post - processing when it 's not live . That 's a main reason a movie is released months after filming has completed .","Basically , you can move the lights around between camera setups , and you can color correct . In normal \" single camera \" shooting ( Like a normal 30 Rock episode ) , you can and do tweak the lighting pretty much every time you move the camera . Shooting live , you need a flatter \" general purpose \" lighting setup that will work okay for every angle but does n't necessarily look amazing at any angle . You also need all lights above the set and out of the field of view of the cameras in live production , whereas in single camera you can have a light or reflector just off camera for a nice effect . You can get the actors to shift their positions to get better shots . You can refresh makeup between takes . All sorts of little subtle things that you 'd never think of if you 've never been on a set because the end result makes it all look like it happens naturally . In live production , you ca n't change your mind about anything once the show starts . In many cases , you will also use different lenses in live production . In a single camera style shoot , you will have a person dedicated to focusing the camera . ( Focus Puller , or 1st Assistant Camera Operator . ) So , if you want to have nice soft blurry backgrounds that make the subject \" pop \" in the frame , you can shoot with \" wide open \" lenses so only the actor is in focus . To do that , you need to rehearse any camera or actor moves so the focus puller knows how to move the focus setting on the lens through the course of the shot . Autofocus is n't good enough because it does n't always know which thing should be in focus , and if it gets confused it may make the whole picture go blurry and useless for a bit which ruins the shot . The 1AC may need to use a measuring tape to check the exact distance between the camera and the actor to make sure things are exactly in focus , which requires walking into the camera 's field of view during shot setup . Obviously during live production you ca n't have somebody stopping the scene to measure , or repeating a take because focus was n't right so you \" stop down \" the lenses or use different lenses so you do n't get the nice soft background and more of the scene is in focus . When framing shots in single camera , you can put the camera right next to an actor 's face to get an interesting shot . But when shooting live , each camera has to stay out of the field of view of every other camera which limits how interesting and varied the shots can be that you can get . One camera person walking right up to an actor would be visible to the other cameras , ruining their shot in a live production so such gags would have to be * very * carefully planned . Then , in editing you would only pick the nicest looking takes , which is obviously impossible when shooting live . Then you send the project off to color correction where the image gets tweaked and refined until it looks like the director \/ DOP and colorist want it to . This is probably the biggest shift in the image that you are noticing , but it is the hardest to explain . Look for some colorist demo reels on vimeo , and you 'll see some idea of how much the image sometimes gets changed during coloring .","Two main reasons . One , the cameras used in Live TV are often smaller and lighter , with a single color processing chip that results in less color distinction . Cameras on set are either higher end with multiple color processors , or still use Film . Post processing on higher end cameras allows for more polishing and tailoring forthe final product . Two , live TV is typically recorded at 30 frames per second ( or higher ) . Classic film and TV are shot in 24p ( 24 frames per second ) . This is what gives the biggest difference in the \" feel \" of live vs others . This is also why newer 120Hz+ HDTVs have that akward unnatural feel if you 're watching a show shot in 24p but being displayed at much faster refresh rate . In order to make up for the missing frames , the video processor speeds up and slows down certain frame sets ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Live TV looks different from pre-filmed TV because it is being filmed and broadcast in real-time, while pre-filmed TV has already been filmed and edited before it is broadcast.

There may also be mistakes or technical issues that occur during the live broadcast that would not be present in a pre-filmed show. However, live TV can also have a sense of excitement and immediacy that can be difficult to capture in a pre-filmed production."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

The alcohol - based gels work by ruining the bacteria 's cell walls ; alcohol in high concentration is very lethal to nearly all bacteria .

It also strips your skin of some of its natural oils , which is why the hand gels usually have moisturizers in them . Related : Your stomach , and to some extent other parts of the digestive tract , is already protected against * some * chemicals because it 's such a strongly acidic environment anyway and it takes rapid cell replacement and a mucus layer to keep the acid from harming you .

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Key Existential Concepts The meaninglessness of life , the absence of God , the loneliness of being a thinking individual — it sounds like the existentialists were n't the happiest group of folks , right ? Not necessarily true . Read on to get an idea of what existentialism is all about . Absurdity : What human beings encounter when they come into contact with the world . Absurdity is brought about because the human instinct to seek order and meaning is frustrated by the refusal of the world to be orderly or meaningful . Anxiety : Kierkegaard said , \" Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom . \" You feel anxiety because you recognize that you and you alone are responsible for your actions . This produces the two - sided feeling of simultaneous dread and exhilaration . Alienation : The sense that you 're a stranger in the world , or a stranger to yourself . Many aspects of existence can be alienating . One of the primary sources is absurdity . Ironically , the stories and systems developed by philosophy and religion to address that absurdity can be just as alienating . Existence precedes essence : Sartre 's phrase to describe the existential situation humans find themselves in . It refers to the fact that when you 're born , you have no meaning , no purpose , no definition . Human beings exist first , and only later define themselves . The Übermensch : The word Nietzsche uses to refer to his ideal human being . Literally \" overman , \" the word reflects the importance in his philosophy of overcoming — overcoming traditional values , overcoming the herd mentality , and , most importantly , overcoming yourself . You overcome these things so that you might attain something greater . Nietzsche 's Übermensch is an unconventional creator of values , a joyous free spirit , and one who embraces the earth instead of pining away for heaven . The death of God : The death of the notion that belief in God alone , or belief in any religious or philosophical system , is sufficient to provide human beings with the meaning , purpose , and definition they crave . It 's the recognition that , because no external system can provide you with the answers , you must take responsibility for providing them yourself . Subjectivity : Your first - person perspective on the world , including the needs , desires , and emotions that accompany that perspective . The existentialists take this as a valid and important starting point for genuinely human endeavors . This can be contrasted with the scientific mindset , which always starts with objectivity — seeing people in impersonal , objective terms without emotion or appreciation for their individual point of view .","\" You are five Johnny . Go play . \" That 's how you explain existentialism to a five year old .","Here 's are more simple view . Existentialism means that every person has an equal right to exist . No one is favored because they are \" in \" with some deity . This means that no one has the right to impose their views on anyone . Each person decides how to behave and to live with the consequences of those decisions . Harm no others ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Existentialism is a philosophical way of thinking about the world and our place in it. It is concerned with questions about the meaning of life, and what it means to be human. \nOne of the main ideas of existentialism is that each person is responsible for creating their own meaning in life. This means that we have the freedom to choose how we want to live, and that we are responsible for the choices we make. \nExistentialism also emphasizes the importance of individual experience and subjective perspective. It suggests that each person's experience of the world is unique, and that it is up to each individual to decide what is important and meaningful to them. \nExistentialism can be a difficult concept to understand, but one way to think about it is that it is a way of looking at the world that emphasizes the importance of being true to oneself and living a life that is meaningful to you."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

However : I think it would be a very , very long time . We live in a strange age . Adult literacy is much higher than it was 100 years ago , or even 50 years ago .

Stories were written down , but you would n't normally read them for pleasure , but read them out loud as entertainment . But now books and plays and tweets and reddit are written for everyone . The result is that the language has n't really changed that much . Whereas Chaucer ( 200 years before Shakespeare ) is almost impossible to a modern audience , Shakespeare and his contemporaries are quite understandable to a modern audience . And English has been standardised even more since then . Even in my lifetime I 've seen words which had different meanings in different places ( no - one uses the British billion any more ) become standardised , we 're increasingly using American spellings for things ( the British \" sceptic \" has fallen out of use , in favour of the American \" skeptic \" , with many British publishers preferring the second one ) . As we continue to be a society that communicates by writing , so we will continue to read and understand the writing of those before us , and the evolution of the language will slow down . There will be new vocabulary in the future that gets introduced , or old words that take on new meanings . ( \" Computer \" used to be a person whose job it was to calculate numbers . ) There will be new slang , and some old slang will fall out of fashion . There will be new concepts which need words to describe them . But because everything is likely to be archived and easily searchable you can probably go and look up words you do n't know easily enough . So there 's my predictions : in 1000 years they 'll still be reading Harry Potter , and we 'll still be able to understand them ( mostly ) , because the globalisation and the universal usage of written English has caused it to be standardised , and standardisation means the language evolves more slowly .","We ca n't say because we 've never really had the sort of communication and recording technology we have in modern times .

They can also help to save energy because they use less electricity than an air conditioner and can help you feel more comfortable at a higher temperature setting on your thermostat. \nSo, in short, ceiling fans are a useful way to help cool a room and make it feel more comfortable, and they can also help save energy by allowing you to use your air conditioner less."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"Why are companies like Tesla and Toyota giving away their patents ? link to the news : URL_0 It just seems counter intuitive to me . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Especially in the case of Tesla , when they released their Electric Vehicle patents last year , there was not enough electric vehicle infrastructure to make their product useful and desirable for a large market . If they want to create demand , Electric Cars and make EV 's desirable in the mass market , the speed at which new technologies ( for things like range between charges , and increasing the speed of charges ) has to increase , and one of the best ways to create an environment for that is competition . If Tesla and Toyota can create a competitive market for EV 's , new technologies will emerge faster , demand will go up , the market will increase and everybody makes money . In a world where there were only a few EV companies , and they were keeping their patents secret , all of the development and implementation costs would be on them . It would be crazy expensive and require a huge investment . This way , they are better able to spread those costs and that work around . In the end , they may own a smaller percentage of the market , but the market will be much larger then if they had gone for it alone . That 's why Tesla released all of their Electric Vehicle patents last year . The pace of development for the Hydrogen Fuel Cell car has been very very very slow , so Toyota has the same ideas for Fuel Cells . Create a market , increase competition , everybody profits . Also , the goal of getting the world of off fossil fuels ASAP is pretty admirable .","Cars are worthless without the infrastructure to support them . If there are no hydrogen fuel stations , no one is going to buy one of Toyota 's fuel cell cars , no matter how cool and green they may be . So by making it easier for more companies to build fuel cell cars , Toyota encourages more hydrogen stations to open up which will lead to them selling more of these cars too . Likewise , Tesla will benefit if more people build superchargers that work with their vehicles ( something that 's only possible if you can use Tesla 's patents ) . Also , at this point , I 'm pretty sure Elon Musk is building technology because he thinks it 's a good idea and not because he 's trying to make money .","Tesla had a huge incentive with the Gigafactory they 're building . They have a lot more to gain from selling \/ recycling batteries than they could from their patents . I 'm sure somewhere Toyota has a similar incentive somewhere in the chain ."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few reasons why companies like Tesla and Toyota might choose to give away their patents. One reason might be to encourage the development of new technologies or to encourage the widespread adoption of their technologies. By making their patents available to other companies or individuals, they can help to stimulate innovation and competition, which can ultimately lead to the development of new products or services that benefit society as a whole. \nAnother reason that companies might give away their patents is to build partnerships or collaborations with other organizations. By sharing their patents with other companies, they can work together to develop new technologies or products, which can be beneficial for both parties. \nIt's important to note that giving away patents does not necessarily mean that a company is giving up all rights to their technology. They may still be able to license the technology to others or receive compensation for its use in some cases. Ultimately, the decision to give away patents is a strategic one that companies make based on their business goals and the needs of their industry."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

{"question":"What is the trust fund loophole Obama mentioned in his SOTU address ? I keep hearing more about this trust fund loophole and I only kind of understand it . Can anyone explain it like I 'm 5 ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Not really ELI5 - able because it 's a complicated subject but : So , whenever you sell property ( subject to an insane number of rules ) you calculated the amount that you gained or lost on your investment , and if you had a gain ( called a \" capital gain \" ) they you pay taxes on that gain . As an example : you buy $ 10,000 worth of stock , then sell it a year later for $ 30,000 ( good investment ) and pay taxes on your $ 20,000 ( $ 30,000 - $ 10,000 ) profit . Now , for inherited items , this gets a little tricky . So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it . Under the current tax plan , you 're only required to pay taxes on a gain of $ 5,000 , because you 're allowed to use the value at the time of inheritance as your \" basis \" in the stock ( \" basis \" is the technical term for basically \" the value you calculate your gain \/ loss from \" ) . * * Under the new plan :* * you would instead pay taxes on the $ 20,000 gain , using the original $ 10,000 basis from the original purchase of the stock ( with exemptions of something like $ 250,000 per person , to spare the middle class ) . Also , note that capital gains have generally been taxed at a lower percentage than ordinary income ( currently 15 % for anyone in the 25 % income tax bracket or up ) , with the rationale being basically that this will encourage business investment . Of course , since many very rich people make the vast majority of their income in the form of capital gains and not salary , it also causes the famous case of billionaires paying lower tax rates than their secretaries ( see : Buffett , Warren ) . In a related proposal , Obama has suggest raising the capital gains rate to 28 % for couples with incomes in excess of $ 500,000 . Those two changes would result in the government raising a lot of extra revenue ( as well as long - term macroeconomic consequences that I am not qualified to speculate on ) . Source : I prepared taxes professionally for five years","Let 's say you buy stock at $ 10 . You hold it for 20 years , and now it 's worth $ 100 . Normally , when you sell that asset , you pay capital gains taxes on the $ 90 difference in price . Now , you put that stock into a trust and you drop dead before selling it . Your children crack the trust at the $ 100 level . When they sell it , they do n't pay the capital gains tax on the $ 90 profit , as they obtained it at the $ 100 level . Thus , all that income generated from the stock is never taxed at all . As a result , there 's $ 90 per share worth of taxes [ or , more accurately , 20 years of capital gains taxes ] just getting lost .","When you buy capital assets ( think of things like stocks ) , you have what is called a \" basis \" in that asset . Your basis is usually , with some exceptions , what you paid to purchase the asset . So for example , if you bought a share of stock for $ 100 , your basis in that share of stock is $ 100 . When you sell the stock later , if it is worth more than it was when you bought it , you have \" capital gain . \" The capital gain is the increase in value between your basis and the amount you sold it for . So in this example , lets say that 5 years later , the stock is worth $ 150 . When you sell this stock , you have $ 50 of capital gain . Here is the part that Obama calls the \" Trust Fund Loophole . \" When a person dies , then can give their capital assets to a relative . When they do this , the basis in the assets given is automatically changed to same value as the current value of the asset . So in our example , if the person did n't sell the stock , and instead gave it to their daughter when they died , the daughter now owns the stock and the basis is $ 150 . This is important because it allows the daughter to sell the stock immediately , and pay no capital gains taxes . Had the father sold it before he died , he would have paid capital gains taxes on the $ 50 of capital gains ."],"chatgpt_answers":["I'm sorry, but I don't have information about a specific trust fund loophole mentioned by President Obama in a State of the Union address.

A wolf to a dog , or one type of bird into another , for example . Macroevolution , to them , means one species or \" kind \" changing into another . Like fish into things that walk on land . The idea of \" kinds \" comes from the Bible , for example in the story of Noah : > In the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ; They , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort . ( Gen 7:13 - 14 ) This idea does n't necessarily line up with the scientific idea of \" species . \" For example , in this view , all hoofed animals might belong to the same \" kind . \" It does allow them to say that maybe Noah only brought a few animals onto the Ark , representing all of the different \" kinds , \" and then after that , they changed into all the animals we have today ( while still staying within their \" kind \" ) .

Humans call both the urge to create a relationship , and the urge to maintain relationships , \" love \" . All of our emotions are essentially simply our way of perceiving instinctual urges , or at least urges that are strong enough for us to notice them . edit : Animals that do not form mating bonds have different chemical receptors . The hormones that correspond to lust \/ love would have no effect on animals that do n't bond . Those hormones are related to pleasure \/ reward . So , for instance , if a prairie vole ( which forms bonds ) * either * mates or has the hormones injected , they will bond . A montane vole ( which does not bond ) could mate , and it does n't do anything . Inject the hormones that a prairie vole produces from mating , and it has no effect .

The study of motion is definitely a very active area of science that permeates many different fields - evolutionary biology , animal behaviour , human behaviour , animal communication , human communication , origin of communication , psychology , psychiatry , neurobiology ... each look at different questions concerning emotions . In ELI5 words this means that animals are certainly capable of feeling emotions because the neural mechanisms that produce emotions are conserved through evolution , and are similar to the neural mechanisms that produce emotions in ourselves . All mammals , being related through common ancestry , have even more similar and conserved mechanisms - humans are of course mammals too ! But a few things to note : 1 . The way animals express a particular emotion may differ from the way humans express that emotion . For example , humans often smile to exhibit happiness . But for the rest of the primate order smiling is either a signal of submissiveness or fear . This does not mean that other primates are incapable of feeling happiness , but that they very likely express it in different ways from ourselves . We also have to be very mindful that other animals , even cognitively complex ones , may be physically constrained and incapable of complex facial expressions . For example , we know dolphins are capable of a lot of complex cognitive tasks , they are able to identify themselves in the mirror and they may even have names for one another ... but they do n't have the facial musculature to make the expressions that are , well , as expressive as ours . Their emotions may not even be obvious for this reason , but that does n't mean they do n't exist . 2 . Humans like to make emotions poetic , like love . But love is simply a kind of attachment emotion . Humans become attached to each other and objects , sometimes to the point of obsession . Animals also become attached to each other . Mothers and their infants , bonding pairs of adults ... all forms of attachment exhibited in the animal kingdom . Again if you were interested in studying * love * , as a scientist you would actually study * attachment * . I recommend the book [ affective neuroscience : the foundations of human and animal emotions ] ( URL_2 ) . It can be rather technical , but it is very good read . In any case , if we want to objectively study emotion and their origins , we sort of need to take the \" humanity \" out of emotions and look at them in a more universal way .

You can then \" steer \" by changing altitude to where the wind blows the direction you want to go . Which will not be very flexible , so you do know the general direction beforehand , and can predict your flight path relatively well . Not to mention that you do n't go hot - air ballooning with a lot of wind in the first place .","You climb or descend to an altitude where the wind is blowing in the direction you want to go . If the wind is n't favorable at any altitude for flying in the direction you want to go , you do n't launch .","Winds at different altitudes are going in different directions . Let 's say the winds at 500 - 700 ft are SW - NE but from 700 - 900 they are W - E. You can adjust how far North and how far East you eventually get by varying your altitude between the two currents of winds . You 're not likely to find completely opposing wind currents though , so it 's not like you can navigate very sharply . All in all , you are * mostly * at the whim of the winds , but with some level of rudimentary control ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Steering a hot air balloon can be a little bit like riding a bike: you can't just turn wherever you want to go, but you can choose which way to tilt the balloon to try to move in a certain direction. \nTo steer a hot air balloon, the pilot will use a device called a burner to heat the air inside the balloon. The hot air will rise, making the balloon go up. If the pilot wants to go down, they can turn off the burner and let the air inside the balloon cool, causing the balloon to sink. \nTo move the balloon left or right, the pilot can tilt the balloon in the desired direction. The wind will then carry the balloon that way. The pilot can also try to find winds that are blowing in the direction they want to go and use those to help steer the balloon. \nSo while the pilot doesn't have complete control over the balloon's movement, they do have some tools they can use to try to steer it in the direction they want to go."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"Why is suicide\/ assisted suicide illegal ? Why is it that someone terminal , or even just in immense pain can not ask to end their life with ease ? What is the justification behind not allowing it ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["In almost everywhere in the US ( if not everywhere ) , suicide \/ attempted suicide is not illegal . Obviously you can be detained and then committed to an institution but it 's not because its illegal but it 's under some other law that authorizes such actions if there is a reasonable belief someone is a danger to themselves or others . Granted a lot of the repercussions of this are similar to being arrested for illegal acts , being detained , held against your will in a facility , losing some rights etc . , but there 's also some differences such as not having a criminal record . Assisted suicide is illegal though , and that 's partially because the state does n't want to be involved in trying to determine if someone is guilty of murder or if they were just assisting suicide , and the other part being it 's stance against suicide anyhow . Even in states that have death with dignity acts , they 're not exactly assisted suicide . The terminally ill patients meet with multiple doctors over a period of time and the doctor will give the patient a drug that they take on their own , so the doctor is n't directly involved with the death .","If its for someone who is terminally ill and in immense pain I think it can be justified , but the bigger question that comes in to play is ' where do you draw the line ? ' - is it certain illnesses or time frames on how long someone has to live . Mental illness is also a major player , if someone is suffering major depression suicide can seem like a logical answer . However when people are in these suicidal states its often described as being almost drunk with the intention . For the ones that recover its often a blurred memory of what happened . On another angle even though you can say it 's their choice and blah blah , it fucking destroys families and leaves behind giant skeletons in the closets of the people that were the closest to them .","This is not really something that can be explained like you 're five . This is n't something that can be explained at all . This is a long philosophical debate with no correct answer , and it depends on where * you * want to draw the line and what sort of morals * you * hold . But I guess the tl;Dr of it would be because those who consider suicide are often not in a healthy mental state to make logical and critical decisions . Suicidal individuals are often depressed . They can only see one side of things : the negative side . For example , if a suicidal individual sends you a text and you , for one reason or another , do n't reply , they wo n't take it the same way as a mentally healthy person . We might think \" well he might just be busy or he just does n't want to reply now , \" that is if we think about it at all . A suicidal individual , on the other hand , would probably think \" he does n't want to reply to me . He does n't like me . Nobody likes me . I 'm alone . \" Of course this is just an example , but it gives the general idea , I believe . I went on the verge of feeling suicidal during a phase of depression and I 've considered ending it all a few times . I even had the lyrics of my favorite song scribbled down on a piece of paper and I left it in my wallet just in case I do anything , so it can be taken as a suicide note . It 's a rather weird song . It can easily be interpreted as a celebration of life to give the listener hope , but it can just as easily be depressing and seem like a desperate cry for help . Anyway I 'm digressing . Now that I think about it , I do n't think I 've ever truly had it in me to end it all . I had only considered one side of things and I did n't think about the bigger picture . And when it came to it , had I really ended it all , it would 've been a stupid spur - of - the - moment sort of decision . If you 're talking about euthanasia , however , then that 's something completely different . I hope that explains it ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Suicide and assisted suicide are generally illegal because they are considered to be harmful and a violation of the individual's inherent right to life. Many people believe that every person has the right to live their life to the fullest and that it is not up to anyone else to decide when that life should end. Additionally, some people believe that suicide and assisted suicide go against the values of many societies and religions, which often view suicide as a sin or a moral failing. \nThere are also practical considerations that can make suicide and assisted suicide difficult to allow. For example, if someone is in immense pain, there may be medical treatments or other forms of support that can help alleviate that pain and make their life more bearable.

Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["There are some simple rules for calculating with db . The easiest one to remember is that multiplying something by a numbers adds something to the db value . Multiplying with 10 adds exactly 10 db . So you would hear all the people talking at 30 db . Another rule that is handy to now is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db . That means 2 people would make 23 db noise , 4 people 26 db and 8 people 29 db . In addition to that you can split larger numbers up for example multiplying by 80 ( for example 80 talking people ) would be 8 * 10 which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 and with the mentioned rules you get 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 19db more .

You could think of it as a dice roll . On easy , the computer blocks you if it rolls 4 or more . On hard , it will block you if it rolls 2 or more , increasing the chance that you will be blocked .","There 's a lot of different ways to alter difficulty in a game like that , it really just depends on how the AI is constructed . For example , every player has different stats ( some good at shooting three - pointers , some good at long passes , etc . ) . On the easy setting maybe each AI player is not aware of the other players stats and it chooses to pass the ball randomly instead of considering their teammates proficiencies . On a higher difficulty each AI player might have full access to the other AI players ' stats and so it will only pass the ball to the person who can shoot the best from that distance . Additionally the game could just skew the AI stats based on the difficulty . Maybe on easy it drops everyone 's ability to shoot \/ pass \/ whatever by an amount , on medium it uses their actual stats , and on hard it increases their stats by an amount so everyone on the team can shoot \/ pass \/ whatever really well . In a lot of AI structures the main way to alter behavior like this is to add randomness . You normally have them make a decision based on the data present ( i.e. pass to the guy with the best shooting ability ) but then you set a threshold for randomness , so say 5 % of the time instead of passing to the best player you pass to a random player . To make the game more easy \/ difficult you could alter the chance of them taking random actions instead of optimal actions . There are a lot of different AI structures that could be used for decision making for things like sports games , but each of them can be skewed to make certain decisions by altering the parameters in the game .","Strip down flashy graphics and animations , and most sports games are relatively simple exercises .

What 's more , it can \" cheat \" if it has to since it knows your inputs as well as the exact limits of what 's possible in the game environment . Always losing a game would be no fun , so there needs to be some way to introduce mistakes into the computer 's decision making .

On the other hand, to make the game harder, the developers might give the computer-controlled players more skill, or make them more likely to make good plays. \nThere are many other ways that difficulty settings can be implemented, depending on the specific game and the type of challenges that it presents to the player.

You can make a microphone like this , but it 's not the most efficient way to do it . They usually use other components . Now imagine you have two tones , one high and one low .

The whole system makes a lot more sense now !"],"chatgpt_answers":["Speakers produce sound by vibrating a flexible membrane called a diaphragm. When an electrical signal is sent to the speaker, it causes the diaphragm to move back and forth rapidly, creating sound waves in the air. \nThe shape and movement of the diaphragm determines the type of sound that the speaker produces. For example, if the diaphragm moves in a simple, regular pattern, it will produce a pure tone or sine wave. However, if the diaphragm moves in a more complex pattern, it can produce more complex waveforms, such as those found in music and other sounds. \nTo create these complex waveforms, the speaker uses multiple small electrical signals that are combined together. Each signal causes a specific part of the diaphragm to vibrate in a certain way, and when all of these vibrations are combined, they create the overall movement of the diaphragm. \nThink of it like a group of people all clapping together to make a beat. Each person is making a simple clapping motion, but when they all clap together, they create a more complex and varied sound.

Surrender is a common aspect of warfare, and it is not uncommon for countries to surrender when they are unable to continue fighting or when the cost of continuing to fight is too high. \nDuring World War II, France was one of the major powers that was part of the Allied powers, which also included countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. France was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, and after a series of battles, the French government was forced to sign an armistice with Germany, which effectively ended the fighting between the two countries. \nIt is important to remember that the decision to surrender is often a difficult one that is made by governments and military leaders, and it is not meant to be taken lightly. Surrendering can be seen as a way to protect the lives and well-being of the people in the country, and it can also be a way to end a conflict that has caused a lot of suffering and destruction.

There is also to my knowledge no mountains that are close to the equator in America","There are a lot of things you want out of a launch site . The first is that you want it in your own country . Many rocket payloads are sensitive to national security and you do n't want to ship them to another country to launch them . Next you need a big area where debris can rain down in the event of either a launch failure or just stage separation . Thus far there are no launch vehicles that can get a payload to orbit with a single stage from launch , so there 's going to be * something * dropping from every launch . Oceans work very well for this , as does Siberia . Oceans and mountains are often far apart . After that you tend to want to be close to the equator , at least for most launches . If you 're going into a \" normal \" orbit then launch eastward to make use of the rotational velocity of the earth . This can be as much as 1000 mph that you do n't have to achieve on your own , which is a big deal . Some launches require going pretty much directly north or south ( e.g. Sun Synchronous or Polar orbits ) , for which Vandenburg AFB in California is useful . When you put all of these requirements together you 're left with some pretty obvious choices for launch locations . The southern - most areas in the US that are near vast uninhabited areas ( i.e. oceans ) are the Southern tip of Texas , California , and Florida . Florida is more conveniently located ( plenty of industry nearby ) so it got the bid for most of NASA 's launches . California is only good if you 're not launching East , so it 's used for some launches . Now SpaceX has started construction on a facility in the southern tip of Texas to have their own facility . * * * * * * * With all of that said , yes , you would like a higher launch site , all else being equal . It gets you above a lot of the atmosphere which can be a real drag ; pun most definitely intended . However , all else is not equal and the other concerns are more substantial . It 's worth pointing out that getting to orbit is n't about getting to a high altitude — orbit is only about 250 miles up ( altitude of the ISS ) . It 's about getting to a high speed . The space shuttle can get to the altitude of the top of Mt Everest in about 52 seconds , and that 's not even traveling straight up .

Routers are in charge of taking those packets and forwarding them to the correct destination . When you watch a YouTube video you are receiving packets of information from a content provider 's servers . Data packets are sent from there through multiple routers ( including your home router ) , eventually hitting your computer .

On the other hand i hate them for gaming , i sometimes confuse what happens around me for things in game and people on team speak hear my game sound when i turn it up too much . Using the closed phones allows me to leave the world behind and just life in the game for a while . For travelling \/ noisy environments i never carry around headphones ( i do n't know why anyone does ... i guess mostly for posing reason ) . My rather cheap in ear headphones cancel the noise and have good enough sound for my daily train rides . With all the noise in the background i wo n't enjoy the higher quality from the other headphones anyway . And i would hate to break my better headphones by accident while they are in my bag . Edit : And while i love listening to old guitar songs , concerts and things like that with my good headphones ( they 're like goosebumps guarantee for good songs ) i feel like most party \/ dance music really does n't do to well with good speakers ... you really start to notice cheap effects and it just makes some songs unenjoyable for me , not sure if anyone else has noticed the same . Usually headphone people tend to only brag about how good the sound becomes with great headphones .","Open : Your ears sit in a cup which is open to the atmosphere . Advantages : Supposedly a more \" open and expansive sound \" Disadvantages : They leak noise a lot . ( both ways ) thus quiet details in music can get lost Closed : Your ears sit in a sealed cup not open to the atmosphere Advantages : Supposedly better bass and less noise intrusion from outside ( and less noise leakage ) Disadvantages : Supposedly a more \" Shut - in \" and less dynamic sound Fun fact : Closed earphones are not fun if you have blocked Eustachian tubes","The physical construction of open back headphones means that your ear is still exposed to everything around you . This tends to make the sound more \" airy \" and \" expansive \" - some would say improving the \" soundstage \" . If you are unfamiliar with the concept of \" soundstage \" , this is a term loosely describing the headphone 's ability to recreate the sound in 3 - dimensional space ( think of it kind of like the difference between having 2.1 speakers and surround sound ) . Since the noise does n't reverberate in the headset on open back models , the bass response tends to be weaker than closed back headphones , but this can also improve the clarity of the sound . Because you are open to the environment , noise leaks to and from the headset as well : if you are not in a quiet environment the background noise will leak a lot into what you are listening to , and people nearby would be able to hear it quite clearly . Closed back headsets are the opposite to the above . Your ears are isolated from the environment . The sound tends to be \" fuller \" and \" more powerful \" - the soundstage is typically worse ( sounds more \" in your head \" compared to open - back headphones ) , though this can vary a lot still depending on a bunch of factors . Noise reverberates in the headset , tending to make the bass frequencies sound more powerful , though this can also obscure some of the finer details ( sometimes described as having a \" muddy \" bass for instance ) . You are isolated from the environment , and background noise will be greatly muffled and obscured , hearing only the noise the headphones are playing . The usages for each vary , but it 's basically personal preference . Each type just provides a different listening experience and it 's subjective what people will prefer . The main drawback of open - back headphones is the noise leakage , meaning they typically are n't suitable for everyday use ( you would n't be able to use them on a bus or train for instance ) . A niche application for open - back headphones that comes to mind is competitive gaming - competitive gamers value the excellent soundstage which gives great directional cues ( for instance , picking the direction of footsteps in a shooter game ) and the more balanced sound signature can prevent the game 's sound effects from becoming overwhelming ( stop loud , bassy sound effects like explosions from interfering too much with audio cues - conversely some may prefer closed back headphones for the opposite reason in that it makes sound effects like this sound more weighty and immersive )"],"chatgpt_answers":["Open-back headphones have a design where the ear cups are not sealed and allow sound to pass through them. This can give a more natural and open sound, as if you are listening to speakers in a room rather than headphones on your head. The sound from open-back headphones may also be more spacious and have a wider soundstage, which can be beneficial for certain types of music and audio recording. \nOn the other hand, closed-back headphones have a design where the ear cups are sealed and do not allow sound to pass through them. This can provide a more isolated listening experience and can be helpful for blocking out external noise. Closed-back headphones are often preferred for noisy environments or for use in situations where you do not want others to hear what you are listening to. They are also often used for monitoring in recording studios, as they can help to prevent sound leakage into microphones. \nBoth open-back and closed-back headphones have their own advantages and disadvantages, and which one is best for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Some people prefer open-back headphones for their natural sound, while others prefer closed-back headphones for their isolation and ability to block out external noise.

That means that 1\/3 is equal to one of those three pieces of pie. \nNow, let's talk about decimals. A decimal is another way of representing a part of a whole. Instead of using fractions, we use numbers that are less than one, like 0.1 or 0.5.

To do this, we can divide the number on the top (also called the numerator) by the number on the bottom (also called the denominator). For example, let's say we have the fraction 3\/3.

Anyone know how it works ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Basic overview : Your body demands energy . It breaks down fat molecules into lower energy molecules , and uses the energy . The chemical reaction looks like this : Fat + O2 - > H2O + CO2 So , you 're body takes in oxygen when you breathe . That oxygen reacts with the fat molecule , that has hydrogen , oxygen and carbon to form carbon dioxide and water .","You have a certain number of fat cells . Even when you lose fat , you keep the same number of fat cells . When you gain weight in the form of fat , what 's happening is that your body is storing energy ( in the form of triglyceride or triglycerol , ca n't remember which ) inside your fat cells . When fat is \" liberated \" from your fat cells , a process called lipolysis will turn that triglyceride into glycerol and three free fat acids ( FFAs ) . The FFAs enter the blood stream and make their way to the muscles . The muscles say , \" ermagerd , gimme \" and hand the FFAs off to their mitochondria . A chemical process occurs that splits up the FFAs super long chains of carbon atoms , turning it into something called Acetyl - CoA. This molecule can be used to make adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , which is what powers a cell . During all of these processes , the fatty acid is oxidized ( I forget how many times ) . Fatty acid is mostly made of carbon . Carbon + oxygen = CO2 . So one of the ways you get rid of the fat you 've used is to breathe out . Please note that I am not a scientist , and am happy to be corrected by someone who is .","The ELI5 answer is , you breathe and sweat it out . Fat is a great source of energy , about 3500 calories per pound .

Your body has a limited amount of energy stored in the form of glycogen (a type of carbohydrate) in your muscles and liver, and when that runs out, it turns to fat as an energy source. \nHere's how it works: \n1. When you start exercising, your body breaks down glycogen stored in your muscles and liver into glucose (a type of sugar) to use for energy. \n2. As you continue to exercise, your body uses up more and more glycogen and starts to use fat as an energy source. \n3. When your body uses fat for energy, it breaks down the fat molecules into smaller parts, including glycerol and fatty acids. \n4. The glycerol and fatty acids are then taken to your cells, where they are used to produce energy through a process called cellular respiration. \n5.

{"question":"why train wheels are n't made from a material with more friction than metal , metal on metal tracks does n't seem very efficient Pretty self explanatory , metal must be pretty wank in terms of friction so why are n't the wheels coated in rubber or the like Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Short answer : It is actually BECAUSE they have less friction . Less friction = less wasted energy . \" A turning steel wheel in contact with a steel rail reduces by 85 - 99 % the amount of rolling friction than a rolling rubber truck tire has in contact with an asphalt or concrete pavement . \" [ Long Answer ] ( URL_0 )","Besides \/u \/ mugged99 's comment about tires \/ rubber being gone in no time ..... the acceleration \/ deceleration traction requirements pale in comparison to the energy expenditure in just keeping such a large heavy thing going . One engine is required for 20 - 30 cars just to keep them going against the friction of their steel wheels . You 'd need twice as many engines or more if they had rubber wheels . A train spends relatively little of its time accelerating and decelerating .... the only times you want friction in a train . And in fact , having the wheels of a trail float , frictionless , a bit on the rails is a necessity for curves . [ As Richard Feynman explained . ] ( URL_0 )","Trains do n't accelerate or decelerate quickly , and the enormous weight of the trains ensures that there is sufficient friction . Metal wheels are also much more durable than would be rubber or something . A sign of insufficient friction would be the engine delivering so much power that the wheels spin , something that does n't happen because of the very low power - weight ratio of trains ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Train wheels are often made of metal because metal is strong and durable, and it can withstand the weight and forces involved in carrying a train. Metal is also a good conductor of electricity, which is important for trains that run on electric power. \nThere are a few reasons why train wheels are not made from a material with more friction, like rubber. First, rubber is not as strong as metal, so it might not be able to support the weight of the train as well. Second, rubber can wear out more quickly than metal, so it might need to be replaced more often. Finally, rubber is not a good conductor of electricity, so it would not be suitable for use on electric trains. \nOverall, the use of metal wheels on metal tracks is a very efficient and effective solution for trains. While rubber or other materials with more friction might provide some additional benefits in certain situations, they also come with their own set of challenges and drawbacks."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

Lenses are round because that's the shape that allows them to focus light onto the camera sensor in the most efficient way. A lens works by bending light as it passes through it, and a round shape is particularly good at doing this evenly across the entire image. \nThe camera sensor, on the other hand, is typically rectangular because it is more efficient to use all the space available on the sensor to capture the image. A rectangular sensor can capture a wider field of view than a square sensor of the same size, so it is able to capture more of the scene in a single photograph. \nWhen you look through the viewfinder of an SLR camera, you are looking through the lens itself, which is why the image appears round.

{"question":"Why do people disagree with stem cell research ? am i missing something here ? ?

Many people think embryonic stem cells from abortions , which is incorrect . In fact they come in - vitro fertilisation ( i.e. artificially injecting donated eggs with sperm ) . When couples go for IVF , because they can not conceive naturally scientists fertilise several eggs ( usually around 20 ) in a dish . Obviously nobody wants to be implanted with 20 fertilised eggs , so there are spares left over . They would either go in the bin , or they can be used for research . That 's where scientists get their stem cells from . Embryonic stem cells are only present during very early stages after the sperm fertilises the egg . This is called the blastocyst . If this was taking place inside a woman , she would NOT be pregnant at this stage . A woman is only pregnant after the fertilised egg implants into the uterus wall . Thus , embryonic stem cells are not in any way related to abortions . 2 ) Technically , a fertilised egg * could * be considered as the start of life . The egg carries one set of chromosomes ( 23 ) , and the sperm carries the other ( 23 ) . So when fertilisation takes place and the chromosomes combine ( giving you 2x 23 chromosomes ) and the cell divides , this technically is a brand new combination - an individual - i.e. all of the genetic instructions required create a unique human being . So it 's fair to say that by harvesting stem cells ( thus destroying that embryo ) , you are removing all potential for life .

With that said , a lot of it is a marketing scheme . However , there are some benefits to organic food . None of it comes from \" eating \" it , but by supporting organic food businesses , you are also supporting smaller farming businesses . These smaller farms often treat their animals better ( though not necessarily always ) and leave less of a footprint on the environment . However , the resulting product is often more expensive as well , in addition to the things mentioned above . On the front of GMOs which are generally not considered organic , no — there is no benefit to eating non - genetically modified foods . In fact , one could easily make the argument that GMOs are a very good thing , as they not only decrease the costs of food but also improve the quality of the food , making it larger and more disease - resistant . Neither of these are bad things , contrary to what non - GMO purists would argue . However , the major con to GMOs is that they often leave a larger footprint on the environment due to how they are grown . If a genetically - modified crop is engineered to be resistant to a certain pesticide , a farmer can be expected to use more of that pesticide to keep their crops safe . This can be detrimental to the local environment . However , some GMOs have been engineered to have a beneficial , opposite effect . Another con to GMOs is that they can be patented , making the produce market more competitive for farmers . * * tl;dr**—it does n't matter if the food you eat is organic or not , but there are secondary effects to producing non - organic foods .","It 's a touchy subject on reddit but there are no nutritional differences regardless of how the food is grown","While \" organic \" is becoming just a marketing trend , there is a big difference if you compare , for example , eggs from chicken that have been raised free range in countryside and factory \" made \" eggs .

Some people believe that organic food is healthier because it is grown without these chemicals, and may have higher levels of certain nutrients. However, there is not enough scientific evidence to say for certain that organic food is consistently healthier than conventionally grown food. \nOrganic farming practices can also be better for the environment, as they often involve using fewer pesticides and fertilizers, which can have negative effects on soil and water quality. Additionally, organic farming can promote biodiversity by using a variety of crops and farming methods, rather than relying on a single crop or technique. \nOverall, whether or not organic food is worth the extra cost is a personal decision that depends on your values and priorities.

{"question":"Why have humans evolved so far as to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces ? What purpose does it have ? Just confused as to why we all still grow hair if it does n't really do anything . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["In short because as humans evolved from arboreal dwelling primates to plains dwelling proto humans it was more important to keep cool , and since we sweat to keep cool those who were less hairy tended to cool off better and hence survive better to pass on the less hairy genes . Hair on the top of the head remained because it was likely an effective sun block , and pubic hair probably had some part in sexual attraction or scent retention . Humans in this environment had dark skin pigmentation that evolved as a natural sun block as hair was lost . Once humans began expanding to cooler climates they had learned to use animal skins , and hairy individuals did n't survive any better than less hairy ones , so humans who moved to cold climates did n't have to be hairy to pass on their genes . Edit : Also around 10,000 years ago , give or take , humans in colder climates who 's skin had less pigmentation were more able to make use the decreased sunlight , and eventually the lighter skin became the predominate skin tone in these climates .","I will admit I do n't know much on the leading theories of why we have specific hair patterns , so this may not be the reason why we have the hair we do BUT : Despite the fact that we like to frame it this way , evolution does n't have \" goals \" or intentions . Sometimes selecting for some traits accidentally leads to selecting for other unintended traits . For example , think about breeds of dogs . Oftentimes we breed a dog for a specific physical trait , and by consequence we have dog breeds that similar personality types and similar health problems ( Labs tend to get cancer , etc . ) So that said , we can still grow hair without it serving a purpose .

Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature where organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this can lead to changes in the way that a species looks and functions. \nOne of the ways that human beings have adapted to their environment is by losing the thick coat of fur that many other mammals have. This may have happened because human beings developed the ability to make and wear clothing, which provided protection from the elements and allowed them to live in a wider range of environments. \nAt the same time, human beings still have hair on their heads and faces. This hair serves several purposes. For example, the hair on our heads helps to keep us warm and provides some protection from the sun. The hair on our faces, particularly in men, may have evolved to signal social and sexual maturity, as well as to protect the face from injury. \nSo, in short, the reason why human beings have evolved to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces is because these features have helped us to adapt to our environment and survive as a species."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

Each of these parts is called a degree, and they are used to measure angles. \nOne reason that 360 degrees was chosen as the number of parts to divide a circle into is that it is a highly composite number, which means that it can be evenly divided by many smaller numbers. For example, 360 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360. This makes it easier to do calculations involving angles, because the degree measurements can be divided and multiplied by these smaller numbers. \nAnother reason for using 360 degrees to measure angles is that it allows for a lot of precision. Dividing a circle into 100 parts, for example, would not allow for as much precision in measuring angles as dividing it into 360 parts would. Similarly, dividing a circle into 400 or 1000 parts would not be as useful, because these numbers are not as easily divisible by smaller numbers. \nOverall, the choice to use 360 degrees to measure angles is a practical one that has stood the test of time.

We can lose control of the ends to which these tools are being made . Think of it this way : before there was speech , all we could do to learn was to watch others . Before there was writing , humans essentially had to re - learn everything by ( at best ) being taught by someone else . Before there was computers , we were limited to the speed of data lookup ( how fast you could retrieve the information ) . Before there was the Internet , we were limited by data volume ( how much data your library or computer stored ) . As we made incremental progress , we accelerated our pace of learning , until now we use computers and AI as a sort of \" almost thinking \" tool : we train computers to infer what we will be interested in seeing . In fact , we use computers to design new processors , so you can sort of see how our tools are becoming necessary to make more of their kind . No one person knows where all the transistors are on a CPU anymore , rather we 're using software to ensure that the thing that runs the next generation of software will do a good job . At some point , it 's not inconceivable that this role of computers can pass a point known as \" the singularity \" : imagine someone is designing an AI , but the design of the algorithm gets too complicated to understand . If we get to the point that advanced algorithms are being used to create AI that designs algorithms , and on down the chain , it 's possible that our AI development will proceed _ without us _ .

They are part of a class of supervised learning algorithms termed \" black box \" : you train them up , give them an input , and just have to trust the output , because you ca n't really understand what 's happening in the middle . In the worst case scenario , poorly designed algorithms find ways to prevent us from exerting control . While we will still likely be able to starve them for some time ( cut the cord ) , the deeper we get with AI algorithms , the more powerful they get - but the harder they get to understand . Perhaps , if the figure of merit in their design is \" do stuff as efficiently as possible \" , human - in - the - loop interactions can be so inefficient as to carry less weight than the algorithm itself does , which would cut us out of the decision making . Of course , well designed algorithms would optimize more for \" do stuff as efficiently as possible , with human tuning , and the ability to quit if something goes wrong \" . Since humans decide what the \" goal \" of a well - constructed AI is ( and will for some time to come ) , computers lack their own volition . They are n't going to \" decide \" that they are smarter than us . This means we still understand at least what the AIs we develop are attempting to optimize for . When we let them optimize themselves , it 's not inconceivable , however unlikely , that they choose to optimize for something we do n't think is important .

The planet was much warmer, and there were no mammals or birds. The dominant land animals were reptiles, including dinosaurs. \nOver time, dinosaurs evolved to be well-suited for their environment and the challenges they faced. Some dinosaurs were herbivores, or plant-eaters, and evolved to have strong jaws and teeth for grinding up plants. Other dinosaurs were carnivores, or meat-eaters, and evolved to have sharp teeth and claws for catching and killing prey. \nHowever, dinosaurs did not evolve to be intelligent in the same way that humans did. Intelligence in animals is often linked to the size of their brain relative to their body size, and the brains of most dinosaurs were relatively small compared to their body size. Humans, on the other hand, evolved to have relatively large brains compared to our body size, which has helped us to develop complex societies, technologies, and cultures. \nIt's important to remember that evolution is a process that takes place over millions of years, and it is influenced by a variety of factors, including the environment, the availability of resources, and the challenges that an animal must face in order to survive and reproduce.

Savannah , on the coast , was the first city established in Georgia , and it was the de facto \" capital \" during the time when we were still a colony ( since we were technically governed by England , but the royal governor sat in Savannah ) . When we became a state , Savannah was named the state capital mostly because it always had been . As the state expanded , the population started shifting west and so Augusta , a little further up and west , was chosen as the next capital partially because it was nearer to the new center of the population and partially because it had served as a rotating capital with Savannah whenever the British were constantly laying siege to it during the Revolution . Augusta was the capital for a little bit before they moved it to Louisville , which did n't amount to much . In 1802 , governor John Milledge sent out a party to find the new geographic center of the state and there they would establish the new capital . The surveyors found a natural spring bubbling up close enough to the center , and so decided to establish Milledgeville as the new capital ( and eventually my home town :D ) . Milledgeville served as capital through the Civil War , until 1868 . During Reconstruction , the military governor of Georgia ordered new delegates to meet in Atlanta . Atlanta became the official capital for a few reasons . First , it was a rebirth from being burned down by General Sherman ( even open - minded , progressive liberals in Georgia gag at the mention of his name ) , and it gave Georgia a new start away from its Confederate capital . Also , Milledgeville is surrounded by hills , which made it hard as hell for trains to get in . Atlanta , on the other hand , is relatively flat and actually began life as a train hub called Terminus . It also was a bigger , more modern city on the rise .

And when Italy finally unified again in the 19th Century , it made sense to make Rome the capital again .

The Earth's atmosphere extends about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth, and the peak of Mount Everest is much shorter than that.

Here 's how they test if the pole is still sturdy enough . First , they hit the pole with a hammer , listening to determine if it is hollow . Poles usually rot from the inside out . They then drill small holes in the pole near the ground . They stick a long hook inside and feel whether the wood is still hard or if it has started to rot . If so , they can also measure how much of the diameter is rotten . They then place drying agents in the holes they drilled and cap the holes with wooden plugs . The drying agents will absorb the moisture and slow down the rotting . As said before , the poles are treated with some kind of preservative before being installed . The wood is usually very dry so it has set . Hence , it wo n't warp much and wo n't be affected by rain and snow . Typically , poles will need to be replaced if they are physically broken : hit by a car , touched by a nearby fire , struck by lightning . In warmer climates , a big issue is insects . They will hollow out the pole and nest inside . Sometimes , it 's hard to actually notice because the outside wood looks fine .

For example, it might be easier or more efficient for the manufacturer to package the food in a certain way, even if it means there is some unused space in the package. \nOverall, the amount of unused space in a package of food is a balance between making sure the food stays fresh and protecting it from damage, and making sure the package is practical and efficient to produce."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"Why is so much of the ocean unexplored ? If humans can go into space and land on stuff , why ca n't we explore more of the ocean ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The ocean is a harder location for us to visit . For one , visibility . In space we can see so much because it 's empty and void . We have the Hubble Telescope that can see lightyears away , because there 's nothing blocking it unless the aim is meant that way . In the ocean we have water , a somewhat dense liquid that obstructs light and vision . This can be viewed when looking into a pool , or a lake . It 's darker , dirtier , and distorts light and vision . Viewing the ocean is a harder task in that submarines can only view so much of it . There 's also pressure . In space it 's usually constant depending on speed and where you are in orbit . In the ocean , the deeper you go the denser it gets , and therefore you need stronger and larger submarines or equipment . At that point you 're looking at some nuclear powered submarine that probably is n't designed to survey the floor . We 've been able to map out the depth of the ocean and all the seismic activity , but it 's difficult to actually be there and grab artifacts and experience it . tldr ; ocean is too pressurized and deep and dirty and you 'd have to have the toughest equipment to view a lot of it .","It 's really big , empty , and hostile . The comparison to space is apt , since exploring the ocean floor requires equipment on a scale similar to what is needed for space travel , due to the crushing pressure and whatnot . Unlike space , the visibility underwater is pretty much nill and submersibles ca n't stay underwater for very long , so exploring the entire ocean would be like trying to cut your lawn with a pair of tweezers . Although we discover a new species on virtually every deep - sea dive , there is n't a whole lot of value in it , not to mention that most deep - sea species ca n't be taken out of their habitat without killing them . The resources that would be required to explore the entirety of the oceans vastly outweighs the value of virtually any potential discovery made there , not to mention that it would probably take centuries . Until someone has enough money and resources to blow it all on satisfying their scientific curiosity , science will be moving in more interesting and fruitful directions .","Space is easy as it 's pretty much empty . You only need something that can withstand a vacuum to be there and there is nothing obstructing your view . Underwater however , the deeper your go the higher the pressure becomes , so your ship needs to be extremely strong not to be crunched .

There are several reasons for this: \n1. The ocean is vast and deep, and much of it is completely inhospitable to humans. The average depth of the ocean is about 12,080 feet (3,680 meters), and some parts of the ocean are much deeper than that. \n2. The pressure at the bottom of the ocean is much greater than at the surface, so special equipment is needed to allow humans to explore these depths. \n3. The ocean is also much colder and darker than the surface, which makes it difficult for humans to see and navigate. \n4. Finally, the ocean is home to many different types of dangerous and unpredictable creatures, which can make exploration risky. \nAll of these factors make it much harder and more expensive to explore the ocean than it is to explore space. Despite these challenges, however, humans have made great strides in understanding and exploring the ocean, and we continue to learn more about it every day."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

And the much larger heat shield would be a problem re - entering the atmosphere at lunar return velocities . This is where you want a capsule .","I think I understand what your asking . Why are we using a return capsule when we have a space ship . It is because the space ship does not have enough thrust to enter space on its own .

It was designed to be able to carry people and cargo into space, and then return to Earth and land like an airplane. However, the Space Shuttle had some limitations. It could only carry a certain amount of cargo and it could only stay in space for a limited amount of time before it needed to return to Earth. \nThe Orion spacecraft is a new spacecraft that is being developed by NASA to take people further into space than ever before, including to the Moon and eventually to Mars. Unlike the Space Shuttle, the Orion spacecraft is not reusable. It is designed to be used just once for a single mission, and then discarded. \nOne reason why the Orion spacecraft is designed this way is because it is going to be used for much longer missions than the Space Shuttle was. The Space Shuttle could only stay in space for a few weeks at a time, but the Orion spacecraft is being designed to stay in space for months or even years at a time. It needs to be able to carry a lot of supplies and equipment for the astronauts to use during those long missions. \nAnother reason why the Orion spacecraft is designed to land in the ocean is because it is going to be traveling much faster and further than the Space Shuttle. When it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, it will be moving at a much higher speed and will need to use a heat shield to protect itself from the heat and friction of re-entry.

Stop lights are used to control the flow of traffic at intersections. When you approach a stop light, you'll see a red light, a yellow light, and a green light.

The green light means that you can go through the intersection, but you should still be cautious and make sure it's safe to proceed. \nNow, how does the stop light know when to change? At non-peak times, stop lights use sensors to detect when there are cars waiting at the intersection. When a car is waiting at the intersection, the stop light will stay red for that direction until the sensor no longer detects a car. This helps to keep traffic moving smoothly and efficiently. \nAt peak times, when there is more traffic, the stop light may be programmed to follow a set schedule. For example, the light may stay green for one direction for a certain amount of time, then turn red and stay red for a certain amount of time, then turn green for the other direction. This helps to keep traffic flowing and prevent backups. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}

Natural thing to do for party so supportive of nationalistic symbols and tradition . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The German Emperors were n't really a long - established tradition like other monarchies . They were the Kings of Prussia , the last three of whom adopted the title of German Emperor . Also it 's likely that Hitler partly blamed Wilhelm II for Germany 's defeat in the First World War , so bringing in his grandson to restore the monarchy would n't appeal .","There was a rather long discussion about the relationship of nationalism , monarchy and the whole question of whether the Nazis where left or right - wing recently on \/r \/ badhistory . For some deeper stuff , I therefore recommend this [ post of mine ] ( URL_0 ) . The easy version , for ELI5 : Yes , the Nazis were , by modern definition , right wing , ultra - nationalist , traditionalist ; although they personally pretended to reject this left to right spectrum . What we have to consider is that European , and especially German parliaments and parties have always been very different from the classic American two party system . Meaning that parties with every so slightly differing opinions might easily split up , while it would , for example , be crazy for the Tea party in the US to try to form an independent party from the Republicans . Now , the difference between the Nazis and the National conservatives ( who were monarchists ) was n't actually that small though . That 's what so special both about fascism and communism . Both were essentially an alternative interpretation of the left and right wing at this time . The right wing up until then meant being supportive of the recently disposed monarchy . And the Nazis did actually embrace that narrative of the monarchy , or at least the empire , more than most people grant them here in this thread . In the post I linked , there 's a fairly well known postcard from that time showing Frederick II . \" The Great \" ; Bismarck , chancellor of Prussia and the Empire ; Hindenburg , Chief of Staff at the end of World War II and finally , Hitler . The well known pompous marches , evocative of the Romans ; and the whole term of the \" Third Reich \" show that connection as well . The problem was , that , as others have pointed out , Germans made the Kaiser , Wilhelm II . , responsible for losing World War II - besides Jews and Socialists , due to Nazi propaganda . They also despised the Elitist nature that was even inherent to the late Imperial army , with Nobles taking all the important positions of power and the common men dying in the trenches . They still liked the idea of a powerful Empire though ; and thought that more conservative mores were needed , making greater social freedom responsible for the fall of the republic . ( The same narrative we see with modern right wingers : Multiculturalism and tolerance towards alternative lifestyles weaken the nation . ) Essentially , Hitler made conservatism for the masses . The Nazis never really abandoned their silent admiration for the monarchy though - see the pompous marches and the whole \" Reich\"-narrative . The dethroned Kaiser actually resided in Belgium for the rest of his life and thought that Hitler would eventually reinstate him . When he died , Hitler gave him a pompous funeral ; with Swastikas all around , despite for the Kaiser previously having said that he did not want them to be displayed there . The army was also still heavily influenced by former nobles .
